<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer is A. Here's the detailed explanation:<br>Why Option A is the Best Solution?<br>The requirements are:<br>1.On-premises systems must resolve `cloud.example.com`.<br>2.All VPCs must resolve `cloud.example.com`.<br>3.High performance is required (minimal latency and complexity).<br>Option A meets these requirements by:<br>1.Associating the private hosted zone with all VPCs → Ensures VPC resources can resolve `cloud.example.com` natively via Route 53.<br>2.Creating a Route 53 inbound resolver in the shared services VPC → Provides a centralized DNS resolution endpoint for on-premises queries.<br>3.Using AWS Transit Gateway for connectivity → Ensures low-latency communication between VPCs and on-premises.<br>4.Forwarding on-premises DNS queries to the inbound resolver → Allows on-premises systems to resolve `cloud.example.com` efficiently.<br>Why Other Options Are Incorrect?<br>-Option B: Uses anEC2-based conditional forwarder, which introduces unnecessary management overhead (scaling, patching) compared to Route 53 Resolver (fully managed).<br>-Option C: Associates the private hosted zoneonly with the shared services VPC, meaning other VPCs cannot resolve `cloud.example.com` natively (requires outbound resolver, which adds complexity).<br>-Option D: Similar to Option C, but uses aninbound resolver while still restricting the hosted zone to one VPC, breaking resolution for other VPCs.<br>Key Considerations for Performance<br>-Route 53 private hosted zones provide the fastest DNS resolution within VPCs when associated directly.<br>-Route 53 Resolver (inbound) is fully managed and optimized for hybrid DNS, unlike manual EC2 solutions.<br>-Transit Gateway ensures high-speed connectivity between VPCs and on-premises.<br>Conclusion<br>Option A is the most efficient, scalable, and performant solution, leveraging native AWS services (Route 53 private hosted zones + inbound resolver) without introducing unnecessary complexity.<br>ref:: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/centralized-dns-management-of-hybrid-cloud-withamazon-route-53-and-aws-transit-gateway/ <br><br><br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the best solution for implementing a multi-region failover capability for the company's REST API would be:<br>C.

To allow the new business unit's administrators to make changes to AWS Config rules while maintaining the existing policies, the solution is to create a temporary OU named Onboarding for the new account, as described in option D. By applying an SCP to this OU that allows AWS Config actions, the new account can adjust its AWS Config rules as needed. Once the adjustments are complete, moving the root SCP to the Production OU ensures that the current policies continue to be enforced across all accounts, and moving the new account to the Production OU integrates it with the rest of the organization while applying the same policies.<br>ref:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/transitional-ou.html<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the best solution for migrating the stateful application to AWS while ensuring scalability and a consistent user experience would be:<br>C. Enable Aurora Auto Scaling for Aurora Replicas. Use an Application Load Balancer with the round robin routing and sticky sessions enabled.<br>This solution is optimal because:<br>Aurora Auto Scaling for Aurora Replicas will allow the database tier to automatically scale read capacity based on demand, which is essential as the user base grows significantly.<br>The Application Load Balancer (ALB) is the appropriate choice for HTTP/HTTPS traffic of a web-based application, offering more advanced routing capabilities than a Network Load Balancer.<br>Sticky sessions are crucial for maintaining a consistent user experience with a stateful application, as they ensure that a user's session remains connected to the same EC2 instance throughout their session.<br>Round robin routing with the ALB will distribute incoming traffic evenly across the healthy EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group, providing efficient load distribution.<br>Option A is less suitable because Network Load Balancers operate at the transport layer (TCP/UDP) and are typically used for extreme performance requirements rather than standard web applications. Additionally, NLBs don't natively support sticky sessions in the same way ALBs do, which is critical for this stateful application.<br>Sources<br>REL07-BP01 Use automation when obtaining or scaling resources - AWS Well-Architected Framework（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-10-03/framework/rel_adapt_to_changes_autoscale_adapt.html）<br>HA and automatic scaling for ASP.NET Web Forms applications on AWS - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-asp-net-web-forms/ha-scaling.html）<br>Hyperscaling Aurora MySQL-Compatible to handle sudden traffic growth - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/hyperscale-aurora-mysql/introduction.html）<br>Replatforming backend databases - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-replatforming-cots-applications/replatforming-backend-databases.html）<br>Navigating the Cloud: Joby Aviation’s PLM migration to AWS | AWS for Industries （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/industries/navigating-the-cloud-joby-aviations-plm-migration-to-aws/）<br>

To allow User_DataProcessor to access the S3 bucket from Account B, the following steps need to be taken: <br>In Account A, set the S3 bucket policy to allow access to the bucket from the IAM user in Account B. This is done by adding a statement to the <br>bucket policy that allows the IAM user in Account B to perform the necessary actions (GetObject and ListBucket) on the bucket and its contents. <br>In Account B, create an IAM policy that allows the IAM user (User_DataProcessor) to perform the necessary actions (GetObject and ListBucket) on <br>the S3 bucket and its contents. The policy should reference the ARN of the S3 bucket and the actions that the user is allowed to perform. <br>Note: turning on the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) feature for the S3 bucket in Account A is not necessary for this scenario as it is typically <br>used for allowing web browsers to access resources from different domains. <br><br><br>此题具有一定的争议，可自行确认。建议C&amp;D<br>

<br>Themost cost-effective solution that meets the requirements (minimizing operational complexity while supporting variable load with microservices in containers) is: &nbsp;<br>Option B &nbsp;<br>Upload the container images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). Configure two auto-scaled Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) clusters with the Fargate launch type to handle the expected load. Deploy tasks from the ECR images. Configure two separate Application Load Balancers to direct traffic to the ECS clusters. &nbsp;<br>#Why Option B? &nbsp;<br>1.Serverless & Low Operational Overhead: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -ECS with Fargate is serverless, eliminating the need to manage EC2 instances. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Auto-scaling ensures cost efficiency by adjusting to variable load. &nbsp;<br>2.Container Support: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - ECR stores container images, and ECS deploys them seamlessly. &nbsp;<br>3.Separate Environments: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Two distinct ECS clusters (production & testing) ensure isolation. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Application Load Balancers (ALBs) route traffic appropriately. &nbsp;<br>4.Cost-Effectiveness: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Fargate scales automatically, avoiding over-provisioning. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No Kubernetes overhead (unlike EKS in Option C). &nbsp;<br>#Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>-Option A (Lambda with containers): Lambda is not ideal for long-running microservices (cold starts, concurrency limits). &nbsp;<br>-Option C (EKS with Fargate): EKS introduces unnecessary Kubernetes complexity for this use case. &nbsp;<br>-Option D (Elastic Beanstalk): Not fully serverless, and less suited for microservices compared to ECS Fargate. &nbsp;<br>Conclusion:Option B provides the best balance of cost efficiency, scalability, and operational simplicity. ✅<br><br><br>ref:https://www.densify.com/eks-best-practices/aws-ecs-vs-eks/<br>

<br>Question #8<br>A company has a multi-tier web application that runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The ALB and the Auto Scaling group are replicated in a backup AWS Region. The minimum value and the maximum value for the Auto Scaling group are set to zero. An Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance stores the application’s data. The DB instance has a read replica in the backup Region. The application presents an endpoint to end users by using an Amazon Route 53 record.<br>The company needs to reduce its RTO to less than 15 minutes by giving the application the ability to automatically fail over to the backup Region.The company does not have a large enough budget for an active-active strategy. <br>What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?<br>

A. Reconfigure the application&rsquo;s Route 53 record with a latency-based routing policy that load balances traffic between the two ALBs.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>To reduce the RTO to less than 15 minutes and enable automatic failover to the backup Region, the solution recommended in option B should be implemented. By creating an AWS Lambda function in the backup Region to promote the read replica and modify the Auto Scaling group values, the company can ensure that the backup Region is ready to take over in case of a failure. Configuring Route 53 with a health check that monitors the web application and triggers the Lambda function when the health check status is unhealthy allows for immediate action in the event of a failure. Updating the Route 53 record with a failover policy ensures that traffic is automatically routed to the ALB in the backup Region when the health check fails, facilitating a quick recovery.<br>The correct answer isB. Here's why:<br>Requirements:<br>1.Reduce RTO to &lt;15 minutes with automatic failover to the backup Region.<br>2.No active-active strategy (due to budget constraints).<br>3. Current setup:<br> &nbsp; - Multi-tier web app on EC2 (Auto Scaling + ALB) in primary Region.<br> &nbsp; - Backup Region has ALB + Auto Scaling (min/max = 0).<br> &nbsp; - RDS Multi-AZ in primary Region + read replica in backup Region.<br> &nbsp; - Route 53 manages the application endpoint.<br>Why Option B?<br>-Route 53 Failover Routing Policy: This is the most cost-effective way to automate failover. Route 53 can monitor the health of the primary Region and switch traffic to the backup Region when unhealthy.<br>-Lambda Function: Promotes the RDS read replica to a standalone instance and modifies the Auto Scaling group in the backup Region (scaling from 0 to desired capacity).<br>-Health Check + SNS: Route 53 health checks can trigger the Lambda function via SNS when the primary Region fails.<br>-Meets RTO Requirement: The combination of Route 53 failover and Lambda automation ensures fast recovery (&lt;15 minutes).<br>Why Not Other Options?<br>-A: Latency-based routing doesn’t provide failover; CloudWatch alarms alone don’t ensure Route 53 traffic redirection.<br>-C: Active-active setup (latency routing + equal Auto Scaling) is expensive and against budget constraints. Cross-Region replication via snapshots is slow.<br>-D: Global Accelerator improves performance but doesn’t inherently handle database failover or Auto Scaling adjustments.<br>Conclusion:<br>B is the most cost-effective and automated solution for achieving&lt;15-minute RTO withpassive standby in the backup Region. &nbsp;<br>Answer: B<br>ref:https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-health-checks.html &nbsp;and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-types.html<br>

<br>The correct combination of steps to improve the application's architecture for automatic recovery from failure with minimal downtime is:<br>A,D, andF. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>1.A – Using anElastic Load Balancer (ELB) with anAuto Scaling group (minimum of two instances) ensures high availability for the EC2 instances. If one instance fails, the other can continue serving traffic, and Auto Scaling will replace the failed instance. &nbsp;<br>2.D – Modifying theRDS for MariaDB to a Multi-AZ deployment ensures automatic failover to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if the primary DB instance fails, minimizing downtime. &nbsp;<br>3.F – Creating areplication group for ElastiCache for Redis with Multi-AZ enabled ensures high availability by maintaining a standby replica in a different Availability Zone, allowing automatic failover if the primary node fails. &nbsp;<br> Why not the others? &nbsp;<br>-B – "Unlimited mode" for EC2 instances is not relevant to high availability. &nbsp;<br>-C – A read replica in thesame AZ does not provide automatic failover (Multi-AZ does). &nbsp;<br>-E – ElastiCache does not use Auto Scaling groups; instead, it usesreplication groups with Multi-AZ. &nbsp;<br>Thus, the best combination isA, D, and F. ✅<br><br><br>

<br>To provide a custom error page with the least amount of operational overhead, the solutions architect should create an Amazon S3 bucket to host a static webpage with the custom error pages (option A) and configure Amazon CloudFront to use those custom error pages (option E). This approach allows for a quick and straightforward implementation without the need to modify the underlying infrastructure or manage additional services like AWS Lambda or Route 53 health checks. The custom error pages can be easily updated and maintained in the S3 bucket, and CloudFront can be quickly reconfigured to point to the new error pages, minimizing the impact on the ongoing operations.<br>The correct answers areA andE. &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The requirement is todisplay a custom error page when the ALB returns a502 error (Bad Gateway) due to malformed HTTP headers, with theleast operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>#Option A: &nbsp;<br>-Create an S3 bucket to host a static custom error page. &nbsp;<br>- This is a simple and cost-effective way to serve a static error page without additional infrastructure. &nbsp;<br>#Option E: &nbsp;<br>-Configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a 502 error occurs. &nbsp;<br>- Since CloudFront is already in front of the ALB, this is the most straightforward solution.

<br>The correct answer isA. Here's why:<br>Requirements Summary:<br>1.Private connectivity (no internet traversal).<br>2.No inbound access from outside the company’s VPC.<br>3.Least privilege permissions must be enforced.<br>Why Option A is Correct:<br>-AWS PrivateLink (Interface VPC Endpoint) allows private connectivity between the company’s VPC and the third-party SaaS applicationwithout traversing the internet.<br>- The company creates aninterface VPC endpoint in its own VPC and connects it to the SaaS provider’sendpoint service.<br>-Security groups can restrict access to only the necessary resources, enforcing least privilege.<br>-No inbound access is allowed from outside the company’s VPC (meets security policy).<br>Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>-B. Site-to-Site VPN: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Traffic still traverses an encrypted VPN over the internet (does not fully meet "no internet traversal" requirement). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Network ACLs are less granular than security groups for least privilege.<br>-C. VPC Peering: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires routing configuration that could inadvertently allow unwanted access. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Peering does not inherently enforce least privilege as strictly as PrivateLink. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- SaaS provider’s VPC and company VPC must be in the same region (not always feasible).<br>-D. PrivateLink Endpoint Service (Incorrect Direction): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This would allow the SaaS provider to initiate connections into the company’s VPC (violates "no inbound access" policy). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The company should be the consumer, not the provider, of the endpoint service.<br>Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option A is the only solution that fully meets the requirements of private connectivity, no internet traversal, no inbound access, and least privilege. &nbsp;<br>Answer: A<br>ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-saas.html <br><br><br>- The interface VPC Endpoint will provide local access to the SaaS service from within the company's VPC.

<br>Based on the information provided, the best answer for implementing a patching process with unified reporting across on-premises servers and EC2 instances is:<br>A. Use AWS Systems Manager to manage patches on the on-premises servers and EC2 instances. Use Systems Manager to generate patch compliance reports.<br>This is the correct approach because:<br>AWS Systems Manager is specifically designed to manage both on-premises servers and EC2 instances through the Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent), which can be installed on both types of environments.<br>Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a unified patching solution that works across different operating systems and environments, addressing the company's need to consolidate their variety of patching tools.<br>Systems Manager includes built-in patch compliance reporting capabilities that can generate a single comprehensive report showing the patch status of all servers and instances, which directly fulfills the management requirement.<br>Option B is incorrect because AWS OpsWorks is primarily a configuration management service that uses Chef or Puppet, and while it can help with some aspects of server management, it's not specifically designed for cross-platform patching with unified reporting.<br>Option C is incomplete because while Amazon EventBridge can schedule Systems Manager patch jobs, Amazon Inspector is focused on vulnerability assessment rather than providing comprehensive patch compliance reporting across both on-premises and EC2 environments.<br>AWS Systems Manager (Option A) provides the most comprehensive and purpose-built solution for this specific requirement.<br>Sources<br>Increase visibility and governance on cloud with AWS Cloud Operations services – Part 2 | AWS Cloud Operations & Migrations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/increase-visibility-and-governance-aws-cloud-operations-part-2/）<br>AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager - AWS Systems Manager （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager.html）<br>Getting Started with Patch Manager and Amazon EC2 Systems Manager | AWS Cloud Operations & Migrations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/getting-started-with-patch-manager-and-amazon-ec2-systems-manager/）<br>Automate Systems Manager patching reports via email and Slack notifications in an AWS Organization | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/automate-systems-manager-patching-reports-via-email-and-slack-notifications-in-an-aws-organization/）<br>Patching solution design for mutable EC2 instances - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patch-management-hybrid-cloud/design-standard.html）<br>

<br>Option B is the correct solution as it uses an Auto Scaling lifecycle hook and an Amazon EventBridge rule to detect lifecycle events from the Auto Scaling group. An AWS Lambda function is then invoked on the autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING transition to call the AWS Systems Manager API SendCommand operation to run the document to copy the log files and send CONTINUE to the Auto Scaling group to terminate the instance. This ensures that log files are copied to S3 before the instance is terminated.<br>Problem Analysis:<br>- EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group are terminated before log files are fully copied to S3.<br>- Logs are copied every 15 minutes, but some instances are terminated before the next sync.<br>- Need a mechanism to ensure logs are copiedbefore termination.<br>Why Option B is Correct:<br>1.Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hook: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - A lifecycle hook (`autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING`) pauses instance termination, allowing time to perform actions.<br>2.AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Document: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Uses `SendCommand` to execute a predefined script (stored in SSM) to copy logs to S3.<br> &nbsp; - SSM ensures the script runs even if the instance is in the process of termination.<br>3.EventBridge + Lambda Integration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - EventBridge detects the termination event.<br> &nbsp; - Lambda triggers the SSM `SendCommand` to copy logs.<br> &nbsp; - After completion, Lambda sends `CONTINUE` to Auto Scaling to proceed with termination.<br>Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>-A: Uses `ABANDON` instead of `CONTINUE`, which prevents Auto Scaling from terminating the instance, requiring manual termination (inefficient and error-prone).<br>-C: Changing the log delivery rate to 5 minutes doesn’t guarantee logs are copied before termination. Also, user-data scripts run at launch, not termination.<br>-D: Uses `ABANDON` (incorrect for this use case) and relies on SNS, which adds unnecessary complexity compared to EventBridge + Lambda.<br>Key AWS Services Used:<br>-Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hooks (to delay termination).<br>-AWS Systems Manager (SSM) (to reliably run commands on instances).<br>-Amazon EventBridge (to detect lifecycle events).<br>-AWS Lambda (to trigger SSM and resume termination).<br>Thus,B is the most reliable and automated solution. &nbsp;<br>Answer: B<br>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/infrastructure-and-automation/run-code-before-terminating-an-ec2-auto-scaling-instance/ <br>https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/69532-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/ &nbsp;<br>

<br>The correct answers are:<br>C. Create an authorization to associate the private hosted zone in Account A with the new VPC in Account B. &nbsp;<br>E. Associate a new VPC in Account B with a hosted zone in Account A. Delete the association authorization in Account A.<br> Explanation:<br>1.Private Hosted Zone Sharing Across Accounts: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The private hosted zone (`db.example.com`) is inAccount A, but the application and database inAccount B need to resolve this DNS record. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - To allowAccount B to resolve records fromAccount A's private hosted zone, you must: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; -Authorize the association inAccount A (the hosted zone owner). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; -Associate the VPC inAccount B with the hosted zone inAccount A. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - After the association is complete, the authorization can be deleted (optional but recommended for security). &nbsp;<br>2.Why Other Options Are Incorrect: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -A: Deploying the database on a separate EC2 instance is unnecessary—the issue is DNS resolution, not the database itself. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -B: Manually modifying `/etc/resolv.conf` is not a scalable or recommended solution. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -D: Creating a duplicate private hosted zone inAccount B and setting up replication is overly complex—cross-account VPC association is the correct approach. &nbsp;<br> Steps to Resolve:<br>1.

<br>Based on the information provided, the most cost-efficient and scalable deployment that will resolve the buffering and timeout issues for users is:<br>C. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Point the distribution to an S3 bucket, and migrate the videos from EFS to Amazon S3.<br>This solution is optimal because:<br>Video content delivery is the primary cause of the performance issues. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations worldwide, significantly reducing latency for video streaming.<br>Amazon S3 is designed for high-throughput storage and retrieval of objects like video files, making it much more suitable than EFS for this use case.<br>This approach offloads the video content delivery from the EC2 instances and EFS, allowing the web servers to focus on serving the blog's dynamic content.<br>CloudFront with S3 provides automatic scaling to handle the 10x increase in traffic without requiring manual intervention or complex configurations.<br>The pay-as-you-go pricing model of CloudFront and S3 is more cost-effective for serving video content compared to scaling up EC2 instances or upgrading EFS performance modes.<br>Option A (reconfiguring EFS for maximum I/O) would increase costs significantly without addressing the fundamental issue that EFS isn't optimized for serving video content to many simultaneous users.<br>Option B (using instance store volumes) would be complex to manage, wouldn't persist through instance terminations without additional work, and wouldn't solve the fundamental issue of efficiently delivering video content to users across different geographical locations.<br>Sources<br>Videos are lagging and too slow to load | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUwi8VdIPqSCGjqnpuy0xf5w/videos-are-lagging-and-too-slow-to-load）<br>Video on demand and live streaming video with CloudFront - Amazon CloudFront （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/on-demand-streaming-video.html）<br>Evolving the architecture with Amazon CloudFront - Hosting Static Websites on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-static-websites-aws/evolving-the-architecture-with-amazon-cloudfront.html）<br>Seeking Cost Saving options For ALB with Autoscaling | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUSbPCZMSxTaKYWC07NXryuQ/seeking-cost-saving-options-for-alb-with-autoscaling）<br><br><br>

<br>The correct answer isA. Here's why:<br> Requirements:<br>1.Add a redundant Direct Connect (DX) connection in the same Region – Ensures high availability.<br>2.Provide connectivity to other Regions through the same pair of DX connections – Requires a solution that allows cross-Region connectivity.<br>3.Use the same pair of DX connections as the company expands – Avoids needing additional DX connections for future Regions.<br> Why Option A is Correct:<br>-Direct Connect Gateway (DX Gateway) allows you to connect multiple VPCs (including those in other Regions) to an on-premises network over a single or redundant DX connection.<br>- Steps in Option A:<br> &nbsp;1.Provision a DX Gateway – This enables multi-Region connectivity.<br> &nbsp;2.Delete the existing private VIF – Prepares for a new configuration.<br> &nbsp;3.Create a second DX connection – Provides redundancy.<br> &nbsp;4.Create a new private VIF on each connection and attach them to the DX Gateway – Ensures both connections are used.<br> &nbsp;5.Connect the DX Gateway to the single VPC – Maintains current connectivity while enabling future expansion.<br>-Benefits:<br> &nbsp;-Redundancy: Two DX connections in the same Region.<br> &nbsp;-Multi-Region Support: The DX Gateway allows future expansion to other Regions without additional DX connections.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>-Option B: Only connects the second DX to the same VPC. Doesnot support multi-Region connectivity.<br>-Option C: Uses apublic VIF, which is not suitable for private VPC connectivity (and does not address multi-Region needs).<br>-Option D: Uses aTransit Gateway, which can connect multiple VPCs but doesnot natively support cross-Region DX connectivity (unlike a DX Gateway).<br> Key Takeaway:<br>ADirect Connect Gateway is the correct solution because it enables bothredundancy andmulti-Region connectivity through the same pair of DX connections.<br>

Rollback if Amazon CloudWatch alarms are triggered.<br> Explanation:<br>-AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) simplifies the deployment of serverless applications (including Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).<br>-AWS CodeDeploy integration with SAM enablescanary or linear traffic shifting, allowing gradual rollout of new Lambda versions while monitoring for errors.<br>-Pre-traffic and post-traffic test functions can validate the new version before and after shifting traffic.<br>-Automated rollback occurs if CloudWatch alarms (e.g., error rates) are triggered, reducing downtime and manual intervention.<br>- This approach improves deployment speed (compared to CLI scripts) and provides better error detection and rollback mechanisms.<br> Why not the other options?<br>-A: While CloudFormation helps with infrastructure management, change sets are slower and less automated for Lambda deployments compared to SAM/CodeDeploy.<br>-C: Refactoring CLI scripts still requires manual testing and rollback, which is less efficient than automated traffic shifting and monitoring.<br>-D: Changing CloudFront origins and API Gateway endpoints is overly complex for Lambda version updates and introduces unnecessary overhead.<br>Thus,B is the most efficient and automated solution.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>- Option A: S3 One Zone - IA is designed for less frequently accessed data, but it is more expensive than S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long - term storage. Since the requests are low and availability/speed of retrieval are not concerns, using S3 One Zone - IA will cost more than necessary. So, this option is not the lowest - cost solution.<br> - Option B: Launching an EC2 instance with an EFS file system in the EFS One Zone - IA storage class incurs costs for the EC2 instance (including compute, storage, and networking) and the EFS file system. Managing an EC2 instance also has operational overhead. This is a more complex and costly solution compared to using S3 Glacier Deep Archive in an S3 bucket. So, this option is not the best choice.<br> - Option C: Using an EC2 instance with an EBS Cold HDD (sc1) volume also has costs associated with the EC2 instance and the EBS volume. Additionally, managing the EC2 instance requires more effort. Similar to Option B, this is more expensive and operationally complex than using S3 Glacier Deep Archive. So, this option is not optimal.<br> - Option D: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest - cost storage class in S3, suitable for long - term archived data with infrequent access. Creating an S3 bucket with S3 Glacier Deep Archive as the default storage class, configuring it for website hosting, and restricting access through an S3 interface endpoint meets the requirements. It is a cost - effective solution as it leverages S3's low - cost storage for archived data and provides a secure way to access the data through the corporate intranet. So, this option is the best choice to meet the requirements at the lowest cost. <br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer isA. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1.Use on-premises Active Directory for authentication across AWS accounts (under AWS Organizations). &nbsp;<br>2.Conditional access based on user groups and roles. &nbsp;<br>3.Centralized identity management (user identities must be managed in a single location). &nbsp;<br>4.Existing Site-to-Site VPN ensures connectivity between on-premises AD and AWS. &nbsp;<br>Why Option A is correct: &nbsp;<br>-AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) + SAML 2.0 allows integration with on-premises Active Directory. &nbsp;<br>-SCIM v2.0 enables automatic provisioning of users and groups from AD to AWS IAM Identity Center. &nbsp;<br>-Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) allows conditional access based on user attributes (e.g., group membership). &nbsp;<br>- This setup meets the requirement of managing identities in a single location (Active Directory) while enabling federated access to AWS accounts. &nbsp;<br>Why other options are incorrect: &nbsp;<br>-B: Uses IAM Identity Center as the identity source (not on-premises AD). &nbsp;<br>-C & D: Require manual IAM user/role provisioning (not centralized) and do not leverage AWS IAM Identity Center for seamless multi-account access. &nbsp;<br>Thus,A is the best solution. &nbsp;<br>AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) allows for the integration of on-premises Active Directory with AWS accounts, enabling users to sign in with their existing credentials. By using SAML 2.0, the company can establish a trust relationship between AWS SSO and Active Directory. The SCIM v2.0 protocol can be used for automatic provisioning and de-provisioning of user identities across AWS accounts. ABACs can be implemented to grant access to AWS resources based on user attributes, aligning with the company's security policy for conditional access. This centralized approach ensures that user identities are managed in a single location, meeting the company's requirements.<br>

<br>The correct answer isB. Implement API throttling through a usage plan at the API Gateway level. Ensure that the client application handles code 429 replies without error.<br> Explanation:<br>-Problem Identification: A small number of clients (especially one client) are generating a large number of PUT requests, leading to errors that affect the API’s reputation. The API is non-critical, and clients can tolerate retries.<br>-Solution Approach: <br> &nbsp;-API Throttling with Usage Plans: API Gateway allows you to set throttling limits (rate and burst limits) via usage plans. This ensures that no single client can overwhelm the system with excessive requests.<br> &nbsp;-Handling 429 (Too Many Requests): When throttling is applied, API Gateway returns a `429` status code. The client application should gracefully handle this response (e.g., by implementing retries) instead of showing errors to users.<br>-Why Not Other Options?:<br> &nbsp;-A: While retry logic with exponential backoff is good practice, it doesn’t address the root cause (excessive requests from a single client).<br> &nbsp;-C: API caching improves responsiveness but does not solve throttling issues for PUT requests (caching is typically used for idempotent GET requests).<br> &nbsp;-D: Reserved concurrency in Lambda ensures resource availability but doesn’t prevent API overload from excessive client requests.<br>Thus,B is the best solution to improve customer experience by enforcing fair usage and ensuring clients handle throttling gracefully.<br>

<br>The correct answer isC. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1.High availability & redundancy across Availability Zones (AZs) – This is achieved by deploying resources in multiple AZs and using a Network Load Balancer (NLB). &nbsp;<br>2.Accessible via DNS name (`my.service.com`) – AnA (alias) record pointing to the NLB's DNS name satisfies this. &nbsp;<br>3.Static TCP port & fixed IP addresses for allow lists – The NLB can be assignedElastic IPs (EIPs) per AZ, providing stable IPs that other companies can whitelist. &nbsp;<br>4.Public accessibility – The NLB is internet-facing and uses public IPs. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Correct: &nbsp;<br>- UsesNLB (supports static TCP ports and retains source IP). &nbsp;<br>- AssignsEIPs per AZ to the NLB (fixed IPs for allow lists). &nbsp;<br>-A (alias) record points to the NLB's DNS name (best practice for load balancers). &nbsp;<br>- EC2 instances are registered with the NLB (ensures traffic distribution). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Wrong: &nbsp;<br>-A: Uses EC2 instance EIPs directly (not scalable; no load balancing if an instance fails). &nbsp;<br>-B: Uses ECS cluster public IPs (not fixed; NLB should have EIPs, not the cluster). &nbsp;<br>-D: UsesALB (does not support static TCP ports) and incorrect DNS setup (CNAME with IPs). &nbsp;<br>To meet the requirements of high availability, redundancy, and fixed address assignments, the best solution is to use Amazon EC2 instances with Elastic IP addresses and a Network Load Balancer (NLB). By assigning an Elastic IP address to each Availability Zone and attaching them to the NLB, the service can maintain a fixed address that can be added to allow lists by other companies. The NLB ensures that traffic is distributed across healthy instances and provides redundancy across Availability Zones. Using an A (alias) record set for the DNS name my.service.com and pointing it to the NLB DNS name ensures that the service is accessible using the specified DNS name.<br>

<br>To determine the most cost-effective solution, we analyze the requirements and options as follows:<br><br><br> Key Requirements:<br>1. High Availability: The system must remain highly available, with scheduled jobs meeting SLAs even during failures. This requires distribution across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to avoid single points of failure.<br>2. Consumption-Based Model with No Long-Term Commitments: Solutions must avoid long-term contracts (e.g., reserved instances) and prioritize cost efficiency through flexible pricing.<br>3. Workload Prioritization: Scheduled jobs (65% of usage) have strict SLAs and require guaranteed capacity; user jobs (35% of usage) are non-critical and can use cheaper, interruptible capacity.<br><br><br> Analysis of Options:<br>- Option A: Using only 2 AZs increases risk of downtime if one AZ fails, as remaining capacity may be insufficient to meet scheduled job SLAs. This violates high availability requirements.<br> &nbsp;<br>- Option B: Concentrating all 4 On-Demand Instances in one AZ creates a single point of failure. If that AZ fails, only Spot Instances (interruptible) remain, which cannot guarantee SLA compliance for scheduled jobs.<br><br><br>- Option C: <br> &nbsp;- Distributes 12 instances across 3 AZs (4 per AZ), ensuring redundancy and meeting high availability standards. <br> &nbsp;- 2 On-Demand Instances per AZ with a Savings Plan: Savings Plans offer flexible, consumption-based discounts without locking into specific instances or AZs, aligning with the "no long-term commitments" requirement. They provide guaranteed capacity for critical scheduled jobs.<br> &nbsp;- 2 Spot Instances per AZ: Spot Instances are cost-effective for non-critical user jobs, which can tolerate delays.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer isA. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The security engineer's requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1.Store credentials securely in an AWS-managed service – AWS Secrets Manager is designed for this purpose (better than Parameter Store for secrets management). &nbsp;<br>2.Deploy via AWS CloudFormation – All options use CloudFormation, so this is satisfied. &nbsp;<br>3.Rotate credentials every 90 days – Secrets Manager has built-in rotation capabilities with `RotationSchedule`, reducing operational overhead. &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Best: &nbsp;<br>-AWS Secrets Manager securely stores and manages the database password. &nbsp;<br>-RotationSchedule resource automates rotation every 90 days (no need for manual EventBridge rules). &nbsp;<br>-Lambda function handles the rotation logic (Secrets Manager provides a rotation template). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect: &nbsp;<br>-B: Parameter Store (SecureString) is not ideal for automatic rotation (Secrets Manager is better suited). &nbsp;<br>-C: While possible, using EventBridge for scheduling adds unnecessary complexity compared to Secrets Manager’s built-in rotation. &nbsp;<br>-D: AppSync is not used for credential rotation, and Parameter Store lacks native rotation support like Secrets Manager. &nbsp;<br>Thus,A meets all requirements with theleast operational overhead. <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the two solutions that meet the requirements for making DynamoDB data accessible through a serverless API over HTTPS that scales automatically are:<br>A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure this API with direct integrations to DynamoDB by using API Gateway's AWS integration type.<br>C. Create an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API. Configure this API with integrations to AWS Lambda functions that return data from the DynamoDB tables.<br>Here's why these two options are correct:<br>Option A: API Gateway REST API with direct DynamoDB integration is a valid approach that allows you to connect API Gateway directly to DynamoDB using the AWS service integration type. This eliminates the need for Lambda functions as intermediaries and can be configured using mapping templates. This is a fully serverless solution that scales automatically with demand.<br>Option C: API Gateway HTTP API with Lambda integration is another valid approach where Lambda functions act as intermediaries between the API Gateway and DynamoDB. The Lambda functions can contain business logic to process the data before returning it to the client. This solution is also fully serverless and scales automatically.<br>Option B is incorrect because API Gateway HTTP APIs do not support direct AWS service integrations with DynamoDB. HTTP APIs can only integrate with Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, or private resources in a VPC, but not directly with AWS services like DynamoDB.<br>Both options A and C provide serverless architectures that make DynamoDB data accessible through HTTPS and scale automatically in response to demand, meeting all the requirements specified in the question.<br>Sources<br>Tutorial: Create a CRUD HTTP API with Lambda and DynamoDB - Amazon API Gateway （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-dynamo-db.html）<br>Is Direct Integration API Gateway to DDB Still Supported? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUMtrOZH6XR0WhWaBf2qRtTg/is-direct-integration-api-gateway-to-ddb-still-supported）<br>API Gateway use cases - Amazon API Gateway （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-overview-developer-experience.html）<br>Get started with API Gateway - Serverless （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless/latest/devguide/starter-apigw.html）<br>Building a Serverless Architecture on AWS | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/articles/ARTqFF9AQmSgqrx2BNH-wkbw/building-a-serverless-architecture-on-aws）<br>Use PutIntegration with an AWS SDK or CLI - AWS SDK Code Examples （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/api-gateway_example_api-gateway_PutIntegration_section.html）<br>Community | Using API Gateway mapping templates for direct DynamoDB integrations （https://community.aws/content/2f0C1U6QRHgVMRaN4L8dhMur3EB/using-api-gateway-mapping-templates-for-direct-dynamodb-integrations）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, to implement a redirect service for multiple domains with the least operational effort, the following three steps should be taken:<br>C. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the JSON document in combination with the event message to look up and respond with a redirect URL.<br>E. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy a Lambda@Edge function.<br>F. Create an SSL certificate by using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Include the domains as Subject Alternative Names.<br>This combination provides the most efficient solution because:<br>Lambda@Edge (options C and E together) allows you to run code at AWS edge locations in response to CloudFront events. The Lambda function can use the JSON document to look up the appropriate redirect URL based on the incoming domain name in the request. This is a serverless approach that requires minimal operational effort.<br>CloudFront (option E) provides a global content delivery network that can handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests, which is a requirement. It also integrates seamlessly with Lambda@Edge for the redirect logic.<br>AWS Certificate Manager (option F) allows you to create and manage SSL certificates for all the domains with minimal effort. By including all domains as Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in a single certificate, you can secure all 10 domains without having to manage individual certificates. This certificate can then be attached to the CloudFront distribution to enable HTTPS.<br>This solution meets all the requirements:<br>Handles both HTTP and HTTPS requests<br>Uses the JSON document to map domains to target URLs<br>Works with Route 53 for DNS management<br>Requires minimal operational effort through serverless components<br>Scales automatically to handle visitor traffic<br>The other options would either require more operational effort or wouldn't fully meet the requirements specified in the question.<br>Sources<br>DNS forwarder externally | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QULgvWEouMTuGFdPl53nCB0A/dns-forwarder-externally）<br>Point a domain to your Lightsail instance using Amazon Route 53 - Amazon Lightsail （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-route-53-to-point-a-domain-to-an-instance.html）<br>

<br>The correct answer isA. Here's the detailed explanation:<br>Why Option A is Correct:<br>1.Activate the `costCenter` tag in the management account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS Organizations allows you to activateuser-defined cost allocation tags (like `costCenter`) in themanagement account. Once activated, these tags become available for cost allocation tracking across all member accounts in the organization.<br>2.Configure AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - TheAWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) provides the most detailed breakdown of AWS costs, including resource-level tagging information.<br> &nbsp; - By saving the CUR to anAmazon S3 bucket in the management account, you can analyze costs across all member accounts.<br> &nbsp; - The report includes atag breakdown, allowing you to filter costs by the `costCenter:compliance` tag.<br>3.Accurate Cost Calculation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The CUR provides granular data, ensuring the cost calculation for the security tools isas accurate as possible.<br> &nbsp; - Since the compliance team’s resources are tagged consistently, the report can accurately attribute costs to them.<br>Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>-Option B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- While activating the tag in member accounts is possible, it’snot necessary—the management account can activate the tag for the whole organization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Using a Lambda function to manually calculate costs isless efficient than using CUR’s built-in tag breakdown.<br>-Option C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- TheAWS Cost and Usage Report must be configured in the payer (management) account, not member accounts. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The phrasing "schedule a monthly report" is misleading—CUR is continuous, not scheduled.<br>-Option D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;-Trusted Advisor does not provide cost allocation tagging reports. It focuses on performance, security, and fault tolerance, not detailed billing breakdowns.<br>Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option A is the best solution because it leverages AWS Organizations' tag activation and the detailed cost breakdown provided by AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) to accurately track and allocate costs for the compliance team’s resources. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Remove the FullAWSAccess SCP from the developers account's OU.<br>This is the correct solution because:<br>AWS Organizations applies a default SCP called "FullAWSAccess" to all accounts and OUs when SCPs are first enabled. This default policy allows all actions on all AWS services.<br>SCPs work on a "deny by default" principle, where permissions must be explicitly allowed. However, the default FullAWSAccess SCP is overriding this by allowing all services.<br>When multiple SCPs apply to an account, they work using a logical AND operation. This means that even though the custom SCP is trying to restrict services to only EC2, S3, and DynamoDB, the FullAWSAccess SCP is still allowing all other services.<br>By removing the FullAWSAccess SCP from the developers account's OU, only the custom SCP will apply, which explicitly allows only EC2, S3, and DynamoDB. All other services will be implicitly denied because they're not explicitly allowed in any applicable SCP.<br>Option A (creating explicit deny statements for each service) would be impractical and difficult to maintain as AWS regularly adds new services.<br>Option C (modifying the FullAWSAccess SCP) is incorrect because the FullAWSAccess SCP is a managed policy that cannot be modified.<br>Option D (adding an explicit deny with a wildcard) is unnecessary and could potentially cause unintended consequences. The proper approach is to leverage the implicit deny behavior of SCPs by removing the FullAWSAccess SCP.<br>Sources<br>Restrict outbound network for accounts in my AWS organizations using SCP | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUvA8rKb94QV2ag83SiQ1o2A/restrict-outbound-network-for-accounts-in-my-aws-organizations-using-scp）<br>Enforcing enterprise-wide preventive controls with AWS Organizations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （）https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/enforcing-enterprise-wide-preventive-controls-with-aws-organizations/<br>Service control policy examples - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.html）<br>Using AWS Organizations for security - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/organizations-security.html）<br>SCP not matching implicit Deny | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU9g5-9ZIHSjWa9_xe5006Vw/scp-not-matching-implicit-deny）<br>Service control policies (SCPs) - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html）<br>

<br>The best solution to handle the large and sudden increases in traffic with theleast operational overhead is:<br>D. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the API. Move the EC2 instances to private subnets in the VPC. Add the EC2 instances as targets for the ALB. Update the Route 53 record to point to the ALB.<br> Why?<br>1.Scalability: The ALB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances and can integrate withAuto Scaling (though not explicitly mentioned here, it's easily added later if needed).<br>2.High Availability: The ALB improves fault tolerance by routing traffic only to healthy instances.<br>3.Security: Moving EC2 instances to private subnets enhances security by shielding them from direct internet exposure.<br>4.Least Operational Overhead: This solution requires minimal changes to the existing architecture—no need to refactor into Lambda (Option A), containerize (Option B), or manually manage Route 53 updates (Option C).<br>5.Route 53 Simplification: Instead of managing multiple IPs with a multivalue policy, Route 53 simply points to the ALB’s DNS name.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>-A (Lambda + API Gateway): Requires significant refactoring of the monolithic API into serverless functions, increasing complexity.<br>-B (EKS): Kubernetes introduces high operational overhead for management and scaling.<br>-C (Auto Scaling + Lambda for Route 53 updates): Managing Route 53 dynamically via Lambda is complex and unnecessary when ALB provides a simpler solution.<br>Thus,Option D is the most efficient and scalable approach with minimal operational effort.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create an AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) from the AWS Organizations management account. Allow each team to visualize the CUR through an Amazon QuickSight dashboard.<br>This is the most efficient and recommended approach for the following reasons:<br>Centralized Cost Management: Creating the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) from the management account provides a comprehensive view of costs across the entire organization, including all OUs and their member accounts.<br>Consolidated Data: The management account in AWS Organizations has visibility into the billing and usage data for all member accounts through consolidated billing, making it the ideal place to generate organization-wide cost reports.<br>Scalability: With hundreds of AWS accounts, creating and managing individual CURs in each member account (option C) would be extremely inefficient and difficult to maintain.<br>Data Visualization: Amazon QuickSight can connect to the CUR data and create dashboards that filter the data by OU, allowing each engineering team to see only their relevant cost information.<br>Access Control: Through proper IAM permissions and QuickSight dashboard sharing, each team can be granted access to view only the cost data relevant to their OU.<br>Option A is incorrect because AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) cannot be used to share Cost and Usage Reports between accounts. RAM is designed for sharing AWS resources like subnets, transit gateways, and License Manager configurations, not billing data.<br>Option C is incorrect because it would create unnecessary complexity and management overhead by requiring the creation and maintenance of separate CURs in each of the hundreds of member accounts, rather than leveraging the consolidated view available from the management account.<br>Sources<br>CUR report for Organisation | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QURjr672h1QPGj4ja2fGGnRA/cur-report-for-organisation）<br>Is it possible to view the actual spending and budget values for all accounts through CUDOS? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUGtzcr2LcTbObILBiM63Fgw/is-it-possible-to-view-the-actual-spending-and-budget-values-for-all-accounts-through-cudos）<br>Introducing custom billing views: tailored cost and usage view for your stakeholders | AWS Cloud Financial Management （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/introducing-custom-billing-views-tailored-cost-and-usage-view-relevant-for-your-stakeholders/）<br>Access to CUR and Billing Info | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUAjlooP76TaGBvVSZlyRHyQ/access-to-cur-and-billing-info）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the best data migration strategy for the company is:<br>B. Use AWS DataSync to schedule a daily task to replicate data between the on-premises Windows file server and Amazon FSx.<br>This is the optimal solution because:<br>AWS DataSync is specifically designed for efficient data transfer and synchronization between on-premises storage and AWS cloud storage services. It's ideal for the company's scenario of needing to transfer 5 GB of new data daily.<br>Amazon FSx provides a fully managed native Windows file system in the cloud, which is the perfect target for migrating data from a Windows file server.

<br>The correct answer isB. Here's why:<br> Key Requirements:<br>1.Scalable & Highly Available: The solution must handle 200,000 daily users with no downtime.<br>2.Three-Tier .NET Application: Requires a web tier, application tier, and database tier.<br>3.MySQL Dependency: The database must be highly available and scalable.<br>4.On-Premises to AWS Migration: The solution should leverage AWS best practices for resilience and performance.<br> Why Option B is Correct:<br>-Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes traffic across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and is ideal for web applications (supports HTTP/HTTPS).<br>-EC2 Auto Scaling Group (Multi-AZ): Ensures the application scales horizontally and remains available even if one AZ fails.<br>-Amazon Aurora MySQL (Multi-AZ): Provides high availability with automatic failover and better performance than standard RDS MySQL.<br>-Retain Deletion Policy: Ensures the database is not accidentally deleted during stack updates/deletions.<br>-Route 53 Alias Record: Efficiently routes traffic to the ALB.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>-Option A: Uses aNetwork Load Balancer (NLB), which is better suited for low-latency/TCP traffic rather than web applications. Elastic Beanstalk is acceptable, but CloudFormation (Option B) offers more control for enterprise architectures.<br>-Option C: Overcomplicates the solution by introducingmulti-Region deployment, which is unnecessary for handling 200,000 daily users (a single Region with Multi-AZ is sufficient). Geoproximity routing is not required here.<br>-Option D: UsesSpot Instances for ECS, which is risky for production workloads due to potential interruptions. Also, aSnapshot deletion policy is less robust than aRetain policy for critical databases.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option B provides the most scalable, highly available, and cost-effective solution using ALB, Multi-AZ Aurora MySQL, and CloudFormation for infrastructure-as-code reliability. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>The correct answer isC. Set up an S3 gateway VPC endpoint in the VPC. Attach an endpoint policy to the endpoint to allow the required actions on the S3 bucket.<br> Explanation:<br>1.Current Cost Issue: The service uses NAT gateways for internet access, which incur costs based on data processed and hourly usage. Additionally, the EC2 instances retrieve1 TB of data daily from S3, which traverses the NAT gateways, increasing costs unnecessarily.<br>2.Security Requirement: The service is promoted as highly secure, so changes must not weaken security or increase operational overhead.<br>3.Optimization:<br> &nbsp; -S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Allows private EC2 instances to communicate directly with S3without going through NAT gateways or the public internet, reducing NAT gateway costs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Data transfer via the endpoint isfree (no additional charges for S3 traffic within the same region).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Maintains security since traffic stays within the AWS network.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - An endpoint policy can restrict access to only the required S3 bucket and actions.<br> &nbsp; -No Operational Overhead: VPC endpoints are fully managed by AWS, requiring no maintenance.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>-A. Replace NAT gateways with NAT instances:<br> &nbsp;- NAT instances areless reliable (not highly available like NAT gateways) and requiremanual management (scaling, patching), increasing operational overhead.<br> &nbsp;- Cost savings are minimal compared to eliminating NAT gateway usage for S3 traffic.<br>-B. Move EC2 instances to public subnets and remove NAT gateways:<br> &nbsp;- Exposing EC2 instances to the public internetcompromises security, violating the requirement.<br>-D. Use Amazon EFS instead of S3:<br> &nbsp;- EFS ismore expensive for storage and throughput compared to S3, and it doesn’t address the NAT gateway cost issue.<br> &nbsp;- Adds complexity without solving the core problem.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option C is the most cost-effective and secure solution, eliminating NAT gateway costs for S3 traffic while maintaining security and operational simplicity. <br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the most cost-effective solution for minimizing the cost of the DynamoDB table is:<br>A. Use AWS Application Auto Scaling to increase capacity during the peak period. Purchase reserved RCUs and WCUs to match the average load.<br>This solution is optimal because:<br>Reserved capacity provides significant cost savings (up to 70%) compared to on-demand pricing for the predictable portion of the workload, which in this case is the average load that occurs most of the time.<br>AWS Application Auto Scaling can automatically adjust the provisioned capacity to handle the peak load that occurs once a week for 4 hours, ensuring the application performs well during these periods without having to pay for that extra capacity all the time.<br>Since the peak load is predictable (once a week for 4 hours) and the rest of the time the load is consistent (close to average), this combination of reserved capacity for the baseline and auto-scaling for the peaks provides the most cost-effective approach.<br>Option B (on-demand capacity mode) would be simpler to manage but more expensive for this workload pattern. On-demand mode is typically more cost-effective for unpredictable workloads, but in this case, the workload has a predictable pattern with a consistent baseline.<br>Option C (using DAX) would not be cost-effective because:<br>DAX is designed to improve read performance, but the scenario states the access pattern includes "many more writes to the table than reads"<br>DAX would add additional costs without addressing the core issue of optimizing the write capacity costs, which is the primary concern given the write-heavy workload<br>The combination of reserved capacity for the predictable baseline load and auto-scaling for the weekly peak provides the most cost-effective solution for this specific workload pattern.<br>Sources<br>Choose the right throughput strategy for Amazon DynamoDB applications | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/choose-the-right-throughput-strategy-for-amazon-dynamodb-applications/）<br>Evaluate your DynamoDB table's capacity mode - Amazon DynamoDB （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/CostOptimization_TableCapacityMode.html）<br>Real time Database Dynamodb - Scaling Error | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUpwt70SzaT1qhk6lEhnW9nw/real-time-database-dynamodb-scaling-error）<br>Demystifying Amazon DynamoDB on-demand capacity mode | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/demystifying-amazon-dynamodb-on-demand-capacity-mode/）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Themost cost-effective migration recommendation for this scenario is: &nbsp;<br>Answer: D &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>1.Amazon SQS is a fully managed, cost-effective queue service that eliminates the need to manage your own message broker (like Amazon MQ). It is the better choice for this migration. &nbsp;<br>2.EC2 Auto Scaling is ideal for processing tasks that take up to1 hour per file, as Lambda has a maximum execution time of15 minutes (which rules out options A and C). Auto Scaling allows the system to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Scaleup during business hours when the queue is long. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Scaledown after business hours when the queue is short, reducing costs. &nbsp;<br>3.Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective and scalable storage solution for processed files (compared to Amazon EFS, which is more expensive for this use case). &nbsp;<br>Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>-A & C: Lambda has a15-minute execution limit, making it unsuitable for 1-hour processing tasks. &nbsp;<br>-B: Amazon MQ is more expensive than SQS (since it requires managing a broker). Also, manually launching EC2 instances is less efficient than Auto Scaling. &nbsp;<br>-C: UsingEFS for storage is more expensive and unnecessary compared to S3 for processed files. &nbsp;<br>Thus,Option D provides thebest balance of cost efficiency, scalability, and AWS-native services for this workload.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Configure an SCP to deny the ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress action when the value of the aws:SourceIp condition key is 0.0.0.0/0. Apply the SCP to the NonProd OU.<br>This solution is the most effective with the least operational overhead because:<br>Service Control Policies (SCPs) are preventive controls that can be applied at the OU level to deny specific actions. In this case, denying the ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress action with a condition that checks for 0.0.0.0/0 as the source IP will prevent users from creating open security group rules.<br>SCPs are enforced at the AWS Organizations level and apply to all accounts within the NonProd OU, providing centralized management with minimal configuration.<br>Once configured, the SCP will immediately prevent the creation of non-compliant security group rules without requiring any additional monitoring or remediation steps.<br>This approach has minimal operational overhead as it's a one-time setup that doesn't require enabling or configuring additional services beyond AWS Organizations, which is already in use.<br>Option B (adding the vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports AWS Config managed rule) would have higher operational overhead because:<br>AWS Config rules are detective controls, not preventive. They would detect non-compliant security groups after they've been created but wouldn't prevent their creation.<br>While AWS Config is already configured in each account, implementing and managing the rule would still require more operational effort than an SCP.<br>The Config rule would require additional remediation actions to fix non-compliant resources, whereas the SCP prevents the creation of non-compliant resources in the first place.<br>The SCP approach (Option D) provides a more direct and efficient solution with less operational overhead for preventing the creation of security group rules with 0.0.0.0/0 as the source in the NonProd OU.<br>Sources<br>Enforcing enterprise-wide preventive controls with AWS Organizations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/enforcing-enterprise-wide-preventive-controls-with-aws-organizations/）<br>Protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access using AWS Organizations integrations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/protect-your-aws-resources-from-unauthorized-access-using-aws-organizations-integrations/）<br>Example SCPs for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples_ec2.html）<br>Application team example: Creating an AWS Config rule - AWS Prescriptive Guidance（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/vulnerability-management/application-team-example.html） <br>SCP evaluation - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_evaluation.html）<br>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) controls - AWS Control Tower （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/ec2-rules.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the best solution with the least operational overhead is:<br>B. Create an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API. Implement each webhook logic in a separate AWS Lambda function. Update the Git servers to call the API Gateway endpoint.<br>This solution is optimal for the following reasons:<br>Serverless Architecture: Both API Gateway and Lambda are fully managed serverless services, eliminating the need to manage any infrastructure like EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups, or load balancers.<br>Centralized Management: Using a single API Gateway endpoint provides a centralized entry point for all webhooks, which simplifies the configuration on the Git server side. You only need to update the Git server to point to one endpoint instead of multiple function URLs.<br>Separation of Concerns: Implementing each webhook logic in a separate Lambda function allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each webhook handler.<br>Minimal Operational Overhead: API Gateway HTTP APIs are specifically designed for low-latency, cost-effective API proxying to Lambda functions. They require minimal configuration and maintenance compared to REST APIs.<br>Built-in Features: API Gateway provides built-in features like request validation, throttling, and monitoring that would otherwise need to be implemented separately.<br>Option A (Lambda function URLs) would require updating the Git server configuration for each webhook separately, increasing operational overhead and complexity in management.<br>Option C (AWS App Runner with ALB) introduces unnecessary components like an ALB, which adds complexity and operational overhead compared to the API Gateway approach. App Runner is more suitable for containerized applications rather than simple webhook handlers.<br>The API Gateway with Lambda functions approach provides the best balance of simplicity, scalability, and low operational overhead for this serverless migration.<br>Sources<br>AWS Lambda function URLs - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/choosing-the-right-aws-service-for-your-microservice-endpoints/function-urls.html）<br>Community | EC2 cost optimization:15 ways to save on Amazon EC2 （https://community.aws/content/2hQNGTh6vpwOHTgKELzL8mkqmKb/ec2-cost-optimization-15-ways-to-save-on-amazon-ec2）<br>Lambda Function URL Invoke with ALB | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUYKEaKLPIQ2ui-DkJjHT-kQ/lambda-function-url-invoke-with-alb）<br>Least operational overhead to handle monolithic app | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUuoRkJsZURTe6xML-FfpFNQ/least-operational-overhead-to-handle-monolithic-app）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the two actions that the solutions architect should take to improve the application's performance are:<br>B. Use RDS Proxy to set up a connection pool to the reader endpoint of the Aurora database. <br>D. Move the code for opening the database connection in the Lambda function outside of the event handler.<br>These solutions directly address the performance issues caused by the large number of database connections under high load:<br>RDS Proxy (Option B):<br>RDS Proxy provides connection pooling for Aurora databases, which efficiently manages and reuses database connections.<br>By setting up RDS Proxy to the reader endpoint, read queries can be distributed across the three read replicas while maintaining a controlled number of actual database connections.<br>This significantly reduces connection overhead and prevents connection exhaustion, which is critical when the application is under high load.<br>RDS Proxy also handles connection multiplexing, allowing multiple Lambda invocations to share a smaller pool of database connections.<br>Moving connection code outside the event handler (Option D):<br>In Lambda functions, code outside the event handler executes only when a new execution environment is initialized, not on every invocation.<br>By moving the database connection code outside the handler, the connection can be reused across multiple invocations of the same Lambda instance.<br>This reduces the overhead of repeatedly establishing new database connections for each request, improving response times and reducing the total number of connections.<br>Option C (Lambda Provisioned Concurrency) would help reduce cold starts and improve initial response times, but it doesn't directly address the database connection issue. While it might be beneficial for overall application performance, it's not one of the most effective solutions for the specific problem of managing a large number of database connections.<br>The combination of RDS Proxy for connection pooling and moving the database connection code outside the Lambda event handler provides the most effective solution for improving the application's performance under high load by efficiently managing database connections.<br>Sources<br>Community | We Improved Our Lambda Warm Start Speed by 95%!

<br>The correct answer isC. Here's why:<br> Key Requirements:<br>1.Migrate without interruptions or changes for customers: This requires a seamless cutover with minimal downtime.<br>2.Resolve data loading issues: The aggregation jobs are causing load jobs to fail, so separating the workloads (aggregation vs. data collection) is critical.<br>3.Use AWS services effectively: The solution should leverage AWS managed services for scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.<br> Why Option C is Correct:<br>-AWS DMS for continuous replication: Ensures the on-premises MySQL database is synced with Aurora MySQL before cutover.<br>-Aurora Replica for aggregation jobs: Offloads the aggregation workload to a read replica, preventing interference with the primary database's write performance (resolving the load job failures).<br>-Lambda + ALB for collection endpoints: <br> &nbsp;- Lambda is serverless and scales automatically for the data collection application.<br> &nbsp;- ALB routes traffic to Lambda, providing a single endpoint for customers.<br>-RDS Proxy: Manages database connections efficiently, preventing connection pool issues for Lambda functions.<br>-Cutover process: <br> &nbsp;- After syncing, the DNS record is updated to point to the ALB (minimal downtime).<br> &nbsp;- AWS DMS is disabled post-cutover.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>-A: Uses a Network Load Balancer (NLB) instead of ALB, which is less optimal for HTTP-based Node.js apps. Also, restarting the replica as primary is unnecessary with Aurora's failover capabilities.<br>-B: Uses EC2 instances instead of Lambda, which adds unnecessary management overhead and doesn’t fully leverage serverless scalability.<br>-D: Uses Kinesis for data collection, which is overkill for this use case (simple sensor data loading) and doesn’t address the aggregation job issue as cleanly as an Aurora Replica.<br> Summary:<br>OptionC provides the most seamless migration, resolves the performance issue by separating read/write workloads, and uses the most appropriate AWS services (Lambda, ALB, RDS Proxy, and Aurora Replica). <br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Based on the given question and requirements, the correct solution is:<br>B. In the S3 bucket properties, change the default encryption to server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS). Set an S3 bucket policy to deny unencrypted PutObject requests. Use the AWS CLI to re-upload all objects in the S3 bucket. [[1]](https://repost.aws/questions/QUa2uGgWvVTeCAkp6vKHBmdw/how-to-encrypt-your-object-in-s3)<br>This solution meets the requirements for the following reasons:<br>1. It changes the encryption method from SSE-S3 to SSE-KMS, allowing the company's security team to manage the encryption keys.<br>2. It ensures that all future objects will be encrypted using the new SSE-KMS method by changing the default encryption settings.<br>3. The S3 bucket policy that denies unencrypted PutObject requests adds an extra layer of security, preventing any unencrypted objects from being uploaded. [[2]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingDSSEncryption.html)<br>4. Re-uploading all existing objects using the AWS CLI ensures that all current objects in the bucket are also encrypted with the new SSE-KMS method. [[3]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)<br>Implementation steps:<br>1. Change the default encryption in the S3 bucket properties to SSE-KMS.<br>2. Create a customer-managed KMS key for the security team to manage.<br>3. Set up an S3 bucket policy to deny unencrypted PutObject requests.<br>4. Use the AWS CLI to download and then re-upload all existing objects in the bucket, which will apply the new encryption method.<br>It's important to note that this process may take some time depending on the number and size of objects in the bucket. Also, ensure that proper access controls are in place for the KMS key to maintain the principle of least privilege.<br>Option C is incorrect because it suggests using GetObject and PutObject requests to automatically encrypt objects, which is not a valid method for changing the encryption of existing objects in S3.<br>For the most up-to-date information on S3 encryption and best practices, please refer to the official AWS documentation.<br>Sources<br>[1] [[1] How to encrypt your object in S3 | AWS re:Post] (https://repost.aws/questions/QUa2uGgWvVTeCAkp6vKHBmdw/how-to-encrypt-your-object-in-s3)<br>[3] [[2] Using dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS) - Amazon Simple Storage Service] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingDSSEncryption.html)<br>[6] [[3] Protecting data with server-side encryption - Amazon Simple Storage Service] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer isB. &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The question requires ahighly available and fault-tolerant solution for a web application using CloudFront with an ALB as the origin. The best approach is toset up a secondary origin in another AWS Region and configure CloudFront to failover to it if the primary origin is unhealthy. &nbsp;<br>-Option B suggests: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Deploying a secondary ALB, Auto Scaling group, and EC2 instances in a different AWS Region. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Updating the CloudFront distribution to include thesecond origin. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Creating anorigin group (a feature that allows CloudFront to failover to a secondary origin if the primary fails). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This ensures that if the primary Region fails, CloudFront automatically routes traffic to the secondary Region. &nbsp;<br>Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>-Option A: Uses Route 53 failover with two CloudFront distributions, but this isnot optimal because CloudFront already has built-in origin failover capabilities. Also, Route 53 failover would require DNS propagation time, whereas CloudFront origin failover is faster. &nbsp;<br>-Option C: Suggests adding a second target group to thesame ALB, but this does not providecross-Region redundancy (ALB is Region-bound). &nbsp;<br>-Option D: Uses AWS Global Accelerator, which isunnecessary since CloudFront already provides global distribution. Also, it adds complexity without significant benefits over CloudFront's native failover. &nbsp;<br>Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the best solution because it leverages CloudFront'sorigin failover capability, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance without relying on slower DNS-based failover. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>The correct answer isC. &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The requirement is tocentrally manage a list of internal IP address ranges with theleast operational overhead, allowing developers to reference this list in security group rules. &nbsp;<br>-Option A involves manual updates to an S3 file, SNS notifications, and Lambda functions to update security groups. This introduces complexity and operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>-Option B uses AWS Config rules for compliance checks and remediation, but this is reactive (detects and fixes misconfigurations rather than centrally managing the list). &nbsp;<br>-Option C usesVPC Prefix Lists (a native AWS feature) to store IP ranges and shares them across accounts usingAWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). This allows security groups in any account to reference the centrally managed prefix list, reducing overhead. &nbsp;<br>-Option D suggests referencing a security group from another account, butsecurity groups cannot be shared across accounts in this way (nested security group references only work within the same VPC). &nbsp;<br>Why C is the Best Choice: &nbsp;<br>✅Centralized management (single prefix list in the transit account). &nbsp;<br>✅Least operational overhead (shared via RAM, automatically available in all accounts). &nbsp;<br>✅Directly usable in security group rules (no need for custom automation). &nbsp;<br>Thus,C is the correct answer.<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. Register a block of customer-owned public IP addresses in the AWS account. Create Elastic IP addresses from the address block and assign them to the NAT gateways in the VPC.<br> Explanation:<br>1.Problem Context: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The third-party API only accepts requests from a singlepublic CIDR block (a fixed set of IP addresses).<br> &nbsp; - The web application runs on EC2 instances inprivate subnets, which access the internet viaNAT gateways.<br> &nbsp; - The NAT gateways provide outbound internet connectivity for the EC2 instances, but by default, they useAWS-owned public IPs, which are not fixed or controllable by the customer.<br>2.Why Option B is Correct: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Bybringing your own public IP addresses (BYOIP) and assigning them asElastic IPs (EIPs) to the NAT gateways, all outbound traffic from the EC2 instances will use these fixed IPs.<br> &nbsp; - The third-party API can then whitelist this CIDR block, ensuring the application can still access the API after migration.<br>3.Why Other Options Are Incorrect: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -A: Enabling public IPs for public subnets affects instances in those subnets, not the private subnet EC2 instances calling the API. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -C: ALBs do not support static Elastic IP assignments (they use AWS-managed IPs). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -D: Global Accelerator provides fixed IPs for incoming traffic, not outbound traffic from EC2 instances.<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Assigning customer-owned Elastic IPs to NAT gateways ensures that all outbound API calls from the EC2 instances originate from a known, whitelisted IP range. &nbsp;<br>Final Answer: B<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Instruct the developers to add Amazon S3 permissions to their IAM entities.<br>This is the correct solution because:<br>Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations act as permission boundaries or guardrails that limit the maximum permissions available in an account, but they do not grant any permissions themselves.<br>Even though the SCP content wasn't provided in the question, we can determine that the issue is not with the SCP blocking S3 bucket creation. If that were the case, adding permissions to IAM entities wouldn't help, as SCPs override IAM permissions when they explicitly deny actions.<br>The developers are likely missing the necessary IAM permissions to create S3 buckets. SCPs only define the maximum available permissions, but users still need to have those permissions granted through IAM policies attached to their roles, users, or groups.<br>Option A (adding s3:CreateBucket with "Allow" effect to the SCP) is incorrect because SCPs don't grant permissions; they only restrict them.

<br>The correct answer is C. Take a snapshot of the EBS volume by using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM). Copy the data to Amazon S3.<br> Explanation:<br>1.Requirements:<br> &nbsp; - Back up data from an encrypted EBS volume to Amazon S3.<br> &nbsp; - The application must remain running (no downtime).<br> &nbsp; - The team does not have SSH access (no direct instance access).<br>2.Why Option C is Correct:<br> &nbsp; -EBS Snapshots are the standard way to back up EBS volumes without downtime.<br> &nbsp; -Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) automates snapshot creation and retention.<br> &nbsp; - Snapshots can becopied to S3 (indirectly via AWS Backup or other methods).<br> &nbsp; - No need to access the instance directly (no SSH required).<br> &nbsp; - The application continues running without interruption.<br>3.Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br> &nbsp; -A: While Session Manager allows access without SSH, manually copying data to S3 is inefficient and not scalable for backups.<br> &nbsp; -B & D: Creating a new instance from an AMI involves downtime (reboot/restart), which violates the requirement of continuous service.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option C is the best solution because it usesautomated EBS snapshots (via DLM) to safely back up data without downtime or requiring SSH access.<br>参考：<br>[1] [Storage options for your Amazon EC2 instances - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Storage.html)<br>[3] [Use Amazon S3 with Amazon EC2 instances - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonS3.html)<br>[6] [Migrate to a new instance type by launching a new EC2 instance - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/migrate-instance-configuration.html)<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Create an alias for every new deployed version of the Lambda function. Use the AWS CLI update-alias command with the routing-config parameter to distribute the load.<br>This solution meets the requirements for implementing a canary release deployment for the Lambda-based application because:<br>Lambda aliases with routing configuration provide a built-in way to implement canary deployments for Lambda functions. The routing-config parameter allows you to specify what percentage of traffic should go to the new version versus the old version.<br>This approach allows for gradual traffic shifting between Lambda function versions, which is the essence of a canary deployment. You can start by routing a small percentage of traffic to the new version, monitor its performance, and gradually increase the percentage if everything works well.<br>If issues are detected with the new version, you can quickly revert all traffic back to the previous stable version by updating the alias routing configuration, minimizing potential downtime.<br>This solution doesn't require taking the application offline or creating duplicate infrastructure, ensuring the application continues to serve users during the deployment process.<br>The other options are not as suitable:<br>Option B (using Route 53 weighted routing with a new CloudFormation stack) would require duplicating the entire infrastructure, which is more complex and resource-intensive than necessary.<br>Option C is incorrect because the update-function-configuration command doesn't have a routing-config parameter for traffic distribution.<br>Option D (using CodeDeploy with OneAtATime configuration) doesn't implement a true canary deployment pattern. The OneAtATime deployment configuration deploys to one instance at a time, which isn't appropriate for Lambda functions and doesn't provide the gradual traffic shifting needed for canary releases.<br>Lambda aliases with routing configuration provide the most straightforward and effective way to implement canary deployments for Lambda functions while minimizing risk and potential downtime.<br>Sources<br>Deployment approaches - Serverless Applications Lens （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/deployment-approaches.html）<br>Blue/Green deployment | AWS re:Post （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/deployment-approaches.html）<br>Implement Lambda canary deployments using a weighted alias - AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuring-alias-routing.html）<br>AWS CodeDeploy - Overview of Deployment Options on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/aws-codedeploy.html）<br>Iterate rapidly, stay agile - AWS Serverless Multi-Tier Architectures with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/serverless-multi-tier-architectures-api-gateway-lambda/iterate-rapidly-stay-agile.html）<br>

<br>The correct answers are A and B. &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The Lambda function is timing out because the image processing task is exceeding Lambda's maximum timeout limit (15 minutes) and possibly hitting other resource constraints (memory, CPU). Since the company does not want to manage infrastructure,AWS Fargate (serverless ECS) is the best alternative. &nbsp;<br>#Steps to Refactor the Architecture: &nbsp;<br>1.A. Modify the application deployment by building a Docker image that contains the application code. Publish the image to Amazon ECR. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Containerizing the application allows it to run in a more scalable and flexible environment (ECS Fargate). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Amazon ECR stores the Docker image for deployment. &nbsp;<br>2.B. Create a new Amazon ECS task definition with a compatibility type of AWS Fargate. Configure the task definition to use the new image in Amazon ECR. Adjust the Lambda function to invoke an ECS task when a new file arrives in Amazon S3. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -AWS Fargate removes the need to manage servers (meets the "no infrastructure management" requirement). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The Lambda function can now act as a lightweightorchestrator, triggering an ECS task for heavy processing instead of doing the work itself. &nbsp;<br>Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>-C: Step Functions with Parallel state and provisioned concurrency does not solve the timeout issue (Lambda still has execution limits). &nbsp;<br>-D: UsingEC2-based ECS requires managing infrastructure (violates the requirement). &nbsp;<br>-E: Storing images on EFS and metadata on RDS does not address the core issue (Lambda timeout due to long processing). &nbsp;<br>Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A + B is the best solution—migrating the heavy processing toECS Fargate while keeping Lambda as the lightweight trigger. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Enable the appropriate guardrail from the list of strongly recommended guardrails in AWS Control Tower. Apply the guardrail to the production OU.<br>This is the correct solution because:<br>AWS Control Tower has different types of guardrails: mandatory guardrails and strongly recommended guardrails.<br>Mandatory guardrails are automatically enabled when you set up AWS Control Tower and cannot be disabled. They provide foundational security and operational benefits that are essential for maintaining the integrity of your landing zone.<br>Strongly recommended guardrails are optional but highly advised based on AWS best practices. They can be enabled or disabled according to your organization's needs.<br>The specific guardrail that detects unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instances is called "Detect Whether Storage Encryption is Enabled for Amazon RDS Database Instances" and it is classified as a strongly recommended detective guardrail, not a mandatory guardrail.<br>This guardrail uses AWS Config rules to monitor RDS instances and check whether storage encryption is enabled, which directly addresses the requirement to detect RDS DB instances that are not encrypted at rest in the production OU.<br>Option A is incorrect because mandatory guardrails do not include the specific control for detecting unencrypted RDS instances. Mandatory guardrails focus on foundational security controls that cannot be disabled, while the RDS encryption detection is part of the strongly recommended guardrails that can be selectively applied to specific OUs like the production OU mentioned in the question.<br>Therefore, to implement a policy that will detect Amazon RDS DB instances that are not encrypted at rest in the company's production OU, the company should enable the appropriate guardrail from the list of strongly recommended guardrails in AWS Control Tower and apply it to the production OU.<br>Sources<br>Optional controls - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/designing-control-tower-landing-zone/optional.html）<br>Controls - Management and Governance Cloud Environment Guide （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/management-and-governance-guide/controls.html）<br>Strongly recommended controls with detective behavior - AWS Control Tower （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/strongly-recommended-detective-controls.html）<br>Preventive vs. Proactive vs. Detective Controls in AWS Control Tower | AWS re:Post (https://repost.aws/articles/ARbi64fKJCQsCpqOskL6vb4g/preventive-vs-proactive-vs-detective-controls-in-aws-control-tower)<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>The correct answer isD. &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The company needs toincrease security controls around SSH access andprovide auditing of commands run by engineers. The best approach is to useAWS Systems Manager Session Manager, which provides: &nbsp;<br>No open inbound ports (eliminates SSH security risks) – Session Manager does not require inbound port 22 access, improving security. &nbsp;<br>Auditability – All session activity is logged in AWS CloudTrail and can be stored in S3 or CloudWatch Logs. &nbsp;<br>IAM-based access control – Engineers can be granted permissions via IAM policies. &nbsp;<br>No need for bastion hosts or NAT gateways – Sessions are established via AWS Systems Manager, reducing complexity. &nbsp;<br>Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>-A: EC2 Instance Connect still relies on SSH and temporary SSH keys, which doesn’t fully eliminate SSH exposure. &nbsp;<br>-B & C: Both options still allow direct SSH access (port 22), which is less secure than using Session Manager. While logging helps, it doesn’t remove the attack surface. &nbsp;<br>Correct Answer: &nbsp;<br>D. Create an IAM role with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` managed policy, attach it to EC2 instances, remove SSH security group rules, and have engineers use Session Manager. &nbsp;<br>This approach provides thehighest security and auditing capabilities while eliminating the need for open SSH ports.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Use AWS Budgets to create a fixed monthly budget for each developer's account as part of the account creation process. <br>C. Create an SCP to deny access to costly services and components. Apply the SCP to the developer accounts. <br>F. Create an AWS Budgets alert action to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the budgeted amount is reached.

AWS Budgets allows you to set specific budget amounts and track spending against those budgets.<br>Option C provides preventive controls by using Service Control Policies (SCPs) to deny access to costly services and components. This helps prevent developers from launching expensive resources in the first place, addressing the requirement to ensure "developers are not launching costly services."<br>Option F implements reactive controls by setting up an automated response when the budget limit is reached.

<br>The correct answer isB. Here's why:<br> Key Requirements:<br>1.Migrate Lambda functions and Aurora database to a new AWS account (Target).<br>2.Minimize downtime (critical data processing).<br>3. The Lambda functions are deployed via adeployment package, and Aurora hasautomated backups.<br> Why Option B?<br>-Lambda Migration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Since Lambda functions are deployed via a deployment package, you can download the package from theSource account and recreate the functions in theTarget account. AWS RAMcannot be used to share Lambda functions directly (they are not shareable via RAM), so options C and D are incorrect for Lambda migration.<br> &nbsp;<br>-Aurora Migration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- To minimize downtime, sharing thelive Aurora DB cluster via AWS RAM (instead of restoring from a snapshot) allows theTarget account to clone the database, ensuring minimal disruption. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Automated snapshots (Option A) require arestore operation, which takes longer and causes more downtime compared to cloning a live cluster. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS RAM enables cross-account sharing of Aurora clusters, and cloning is faster than snapshot restoration.<br> Why Not Other Options?<br>-A: Uses a snapshot (slower, more downtime). &nbsp;<br>-C: AWS RAM cannot share Lambda functions. &nbsp;<br>-D: AWS RAM cannot share Lambda functions, and using a snapshot is slower than cloning.<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the best solution because it efficiently migrates the Lambda functions (via redeployment) and minimizes Aurora downtime by using AWS RAM to share and clone the live cluster. &nbsp;<br>Answer: B<br>

The solution must useAmazon Route 53 for DNS-based failover.<br>Let’s analyze the options:<br>#Option A ❌<br>-VPC peering is not required for a multi-Region failover setup (and VPC peering does not work across Regions).<br>- The ALBcannot span multiple VPCs or Regions, so this setup is invalid.<br>- No mention ofRoute 53 failover routing, which is required for active-passive DR.<br>#Option B ❌<br>- Correctly sets upALB + Auto Scaling in both Regions.<br>- However, itlacks a failover routing policy in Route 53, which is necessary for active-passive failover.<br>- Simply enabling health checks is not enough—you need to configurefailover routing.<br>#Option C ✅<br>-Correctly sets up ALB + Auto Scaling in both Regions (us-east-1 as active, us-west-1 as passive).<br>-Route 53 failover routing policy is configured with health checks, ensuring automatic failover if the primary Region fails.<br>- This matches theactive-passive disaster recovery requirement.<br>#Option D ❌<br>- Similar to Option A,VPC peering across Regions is not possible.<br>- The ALBcannot span multiple Regions.<br>- Nofailover routing policy is mentioned, only a single record.<br>Why C is the Best Answer:<br>-High Availability in Primary Region: ALB + Auto Scaling across multiple AZs in us-east-1.<br>-Disaster Recovery in Secondary Region: Passive deployment in us-west-1.<br>-Active-Passive Failover: Route 53 health checks and failover routing ensure automatic switch to us-west-1 if us-east-1 fails.<br>Thus,Option C is the correct solution. <br>

https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/69172-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-topic-1/ You are correct, I apologize for the oversight. To meet the requirements of the IT support workers, option D would be the correct solution: <br>This option will first enable all features in AWS Organizations, then create and configure an AD Connector to connect to the company's one premises Active Directory. Then, it will configure IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) and set the AD Connector as the identity source, allowing the IT support workers to access the console using their existing Active Directory credentials. Finally, it will create permission sets and map them to the existing groups within the company's Active Directory. This solution will also be cost-effective as it does not involve creating a new directory in AWS Directory Service. <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>A. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on the S3 bucket. Configure the app to use the Transfer Acceleration endpoint for uploads.<br>D. Configure the app to break the video files into chunks. Use a multipart upload to transfer files to Amazon S3.<br>These solutions will improve the performance of large file uploads from Australia to the S3 bucket in us-east-1 for the following reasons:<br>S3 Transfer Acceleration (Option A):<br>This feature is specifically designed to optimize long-distance transfers across different geographic regions.<br>It uses Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations to route data through an optimized network path.<br>For users in Australia uploading to us-east-1, Transfer Acceleration can significantly improve transfer speeds (by 50-500% for cross-continental transfers).<br>It addresses the long upload times experienced by Australian users by providing a more efficient network path to the destination bucket.<br>Multipart Uploads (Option D):<br>This approach is particularly effective for large files (1-10 GB in this case).<br>Breaking files into smaller chunks allows for parallel uploads, increasing throughput.<br>If a part fails during upload, only that specific part needs to be retried rather than the entire file.<br>This directly addresses the issue of files failing to completely upload by providing resilience against network interruptions.<br>AWS recommends multipart uploads for files larger than 100MB, which applies to all files in this scenario (1-10 GB).<br>Option E (adding random prefixes) is incorrect because:<br>While prefix strategies can help with S3 performance for high-throughput scenarios with many small files, they don't significantly improve upload speeds for individual large files.<br>Random prefixes help distribute objects across multiple partitions to avoid throttling when you have extremely high request rates, but this doesn't address the network latency and reliability issues experienced by Australian users.<br>The combination of S3 Transfer Acceleration and multipart uploads provides the most effective solution for improving upload performance and reliability for large files being transferred from distant geographic locations like Australia to us-east-1.<br>Sources<br>Troubleshoot cross-region transfer issues - AWS Transfer Family （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/cross-region-transfer-issues.html）<br>Using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to Accelerate Geographically Disparate Data Transfers - Best Practices Design Patterns: Optimizing Amazon S3 Performance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html）<br>Performance guidelines for Amazon S3 - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance-guidelines.html）<br>Selection - Streaming Media Lens （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/streaming-media-lens/selection.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create an RDS proxy. Configure the existing RDS endpoint as a target. Update the connection settings in the application to point to the RDS proxy endpoint.<br>This solution will meet the requirements because:<br>The core issue described in the scenario is that the application loses connections to the database during a failover event and cannot re-establish them without a restart.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Update the IAM policy for the engineers' IAM role with permissions to only allow AWS CloudFormation actions. Create a new IAM policy with permission to provision approved resources, and assign the policy to a new IAM service role. Assign the IAM service role to AWS CloudFormation during stack creation.<br>This solution is the most appropriate because:<br>It follows the principle of least privilege by restricting the engineers' IAM role to only perform CloudFormation actions. This ensures engineers can only provision resources through CloudFormation as required by the new company policy.<br>By creating a separate IAM service role with permissions to provision only approved resources, the solution provides a clear separation of concerns. The engineers don't have direct permissions to create resources - they can only do so through CloudFormation using the service role.<br>When CloudFormation creates resources, it assumes the service role that has been carefully configured with permissions for only approved resources. This creates an additional layer of control and security.<br>This approach makes it easier to audit and track resource creation, as all changes must go through CloudFormation using the defined service role.<br>Option B is less secure because:<br>It gives engineers direct permissions to provision approved resources outside of CloudFormation<br>This could potentially allow engineers to bypass the requirement to use CloudFormation for resource provisioning<br>It doesn't provide the same level of separation between the ability to use CloudFormation and the ability to create resources<br>The approach in Option C is more aligned with AWS security best practices for CloudFormation deployments, as it ensures that:<br>Engineers can only use CloudFormation (enforcing the "must use CloudFormation" policy)<br>Only approved resources can be provisioned (enforcing the "only approved resources" policy)<br>The service role provides a controlled and auditable mechanism for resource creation<br>This implementation provides better security controls and more clearly enforces the new company policy.<br>Sources<br>Configuring least-privilege permissions to use CloudFormation - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/least-privilege-cloudformation/permissions-use-cloudformation.html）<br>Best practices for configuring identity-based policies for least-privilege CloudFormation access - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/least-privilege-cloudformation/best-practices-identity-based-policies.html）<br>Managing permissions for individuals - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts/managing-permissions-for-individuals.html）<br>Service roles for CloudFormation - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/least-privilege-cloudformation/service-roles-for-cloudformation.html）<br>Implementing policies for least-privilege permissions for AWS CloudFormation - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/least-privilege-cloudformation/introduction.html）<br>

Create a replacement read replica that has the promoted DB instance as its source.<br>This solution provides the highest availability for the database because:<br>Cross-Region read replicas in Amazon RDS for MySQL provide a disaster recovery solution that allows the database to remain operational even if an entire AWS Region experiences an outage.<br>The promotion process allows a read replica in another Region to be quickly converted to a standalone database instance that can accept write operations, minimizing downtime during a regional failure.<br>After promoting the read replica and redirecting traffic to it, creating a replacement read replica with the promoted instance as its source maintains the high availability architecture for future resilience.<br>This approach provides a practical and proven method for cross-Region failover with RDS for MySQL databases.<br>Options B and C are incorrect because:<br>Amazon RDS for MySQL does not support "global tables" - this is a feature of DynamoDB and Aurora, not standard RDS MySQL<br>Using AWS Lambda to "copy" read replicas between Regions is not a standard or efficient approach for database failover<br>These solutions describe architectures that don't align with RDS MySQL's actual capabilities<br>The solution in option D represents the standard approach for achieving cross-Region high availability with Amazon RDS for MySQL. It leverages the built-in read replica promotion capability, which is specifically designed for this type of failover scenario.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer isA. Here's why:<br>Scenario Requirements:<br>-On-premises servers need to accessVPC B (in addition to VPC A, which already works).<br>-VPC A andVPC B are already peered.<br>- No IP overlap exists.<br>- Network ACLs and security groups are properly configured.<br>Problem:<br>- The existingSite-to-Site VPN only connectson-premises toVPC A.<br>-VPC peering does NOT support transitive routing, so traffic from on-premises to VPC B won’t work by default.<br>Solution:<br>-Transit Gateway (TGW) allows transitive routing between:<br> &nbsp;- TheSite-to-Site VPN (on-premises)<br> &nbsp;-VPC A<br> &nbsp;-VPC B<br>- By attaching all three to the TGW and updating theroute tables, traffic can flow between all networks.<br>Why Option A?<br>-Least operational effort: <br> &nbsp;- Only requirescreating a TGW, attaching the VPN, VPC A, and VPC B, and updating routes.<br> &nbsp;- No need for additional VPNs (unlike Option B) or complex BGP configurations (unlike Option C).<br> &nbsp;- Option D is invalid because avirtual private gateway cannot be split between VPCs.<br>Why Not Other Options?<br>-B: Unnecessary to create asecond VPN connection (extra effort).<br>-C:BGP propagation is unnecessary and adds complexity (VPC peering doesn’t support transitive routing).<br>-D:Virtual private gateway cannot be shared/modified this way (incorrect approach).<br>Final Answer:<br>✅A. Create a transit gateway. Attach the Site-to-Site VPN, VPC A, and VPC B to the transit gateway.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer isB. Configure the application to connect to Amazon SES by using STARTTLS. Obtain Amazon SES SMTP credentials. Use the credentials to authenticate with Amazon SES.<br> Explanation:<br>1.Legacy SMTP Constraints: The application can only use SMTP (not APIs or SDKs), and the legacy SMTP server does not support TLS encryption, using only TCP port 25. &nbsp;<br>2.Amazon SES Requirements: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - SES requiresTLS encryption (either viaSTARTTLS orTLS Wrapper) for SMTP connections. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Since the application cannot be modified to use APIs/SDKs, using SES SMTP credentials is the best approach. &nbsp;<br>3.STARTTLS vs. TLS Wrapper: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -STARTTLS (Option B) is the correct choice because it upgrades an existing plaintext SMTP connection to an encrypted one (on port 25 or 587). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -TLS Wrapper (Option A) is incorrect because it requires a different port (typically 465) and may not be supported by the legacy application. &nbsp;<br>4.Authentication: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - SES SMTP credentials (username/password) must be used for authentication (not IAM roles or API keys, as SMTP does not support IAM roles directly). &nbsp;<br>5.Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -A: Incorrect because TLS Wrapper is not the standard method for port 25, and IAM roles cannot be used for SMTP authentication. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; -C & D: Incorrect because the applicationcannot use SES APIs or SDKs—it must use SMTP. &nbsp;<br> Correct Steps (Option B):<br>1.Configure the application to connect to theAmazon SES SMTP endpoint (e.g., `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). &nbsp;<br>2.Enable STARTTLS to encrypt the connection (port 25 or 587). &nbsp;<br>3.Generate SES SMTP credentials (IAM user with `ses:SendRawEmail` permissions). &nbsp;<br>4.Authenticate with SES using the SMTP credentials. &nbsp;<br>This approach ensures the legacy application works with SES while meeting security requirements. &nbsp;<br>Answer: B<br>

<br>The correct answer is: &nbsp;<br>A. Create an AWS Cost and Usage Report for the organization. Define tags and cost categories in the report. Create a table in Amazon Athena. Create an Amazon QuickSight dataset based on the Athena table. Share the dataset with the finance team. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>1.AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) provides comprehensive cost and usage data for all accounts in the organization, which is necessary for consolidated reporting. &nbsp;<br>2.Tags and Cost Categories allow meaningful grouping of costs by teams, departments, or business units. &nbsp;<br>3.Amazon Athena can query the CUR data stored in Amazon S3, enabling SQL-based analysis. &nbsp;<br>4.Amazon QuickSight can visualize the data from Athena, and the dataset can be shared with the finance team for self-service reporting. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>-B: AWS Cost Explorer does not support sharing templates, and it lacks the flexibility of a self-managed application. &nbsp;<br>-C: The AWS Price List Query API provides pricing information, not actual spending data. &nbsp;<br>-D: Again, the Price List Query API does not provide actual spending data, and Cost Explorer lacks self-service capabilities for a finance application. &nbsp;<br>Thus,Option A is the best solution for generating a consolidated, customizable cost report.<br>

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is specifically designed for this type of mixed or unpredictable access pattern.<br>Automatic Optimization: S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns:<br>Frequent Access tier for objects that are accessed regularly<br>Infrequent Access tier for objects that haven't been accessed for 30 consecutive days<br>Millisecond Retrieval: Both tiers in S3 Intelligent-Tiering provide millisecond retrieval times, meeting the requirement to maintain "millisecond retrieval availability."<br>Cost Optimization: S3 Intelligent-Tiering can save up to 40% on storage costs for objects that become infrequently accessed, while automatically moving objects back to the Frequent Access tier if they're accessed again, with no retrieval fees.<br>No Performance Impact: There is no performance degradation or change in latency when objects move between tiers, ensuring consistent user experience regardless of how frequently the photos and videos are accessed.<br>Option D (adding a Cache-Control: max-age header set to 30 days) would not effectively address the storage cost optimization requirement because:<br>Cache-Control headers primarily affect how content is cached by browsers and CDNs like CloudFront, not how the data is stored in S3.<br>While caching can reduce the number of requests to S3 (potentially reducing request costs), it doesn't change the underlying storage costs in S3.<br>Cache-Control headers don't move objects between storage tiers based on access patterns.<br>This approach wouldn't distinguish between frequently and infrequently accessed content after 30 days, which is a key requirement in this scenario.<br>S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the most appropriate solution as it automatically optimizes storage costs based on actual access patterns while maintaining the required millisecond retrieval availability for all objects.<br>Sources<br>Managing storage costs with Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intelligent-tiering.html）<br>Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering Storage Class | AWS （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/s3/storage-classes/intelligent-tiering/）<br>Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html）<br>How to Optimize AWS S3 Storage Costs? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU97-ATukcRz-XashRXJSkHA/how-to-optimize-aws-s3-storage-costs）<br>How Rivian optimized cloud storage for its ADAS and Product Engineering workloads on AWS | AWS for Industries （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/industries/how-rivian-optimized-cloud-storage-for-its-adas-and-product-engineering-workloads-on-aws/）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use Amazon S3 Storage Lens. Upgrade the default dashboard to include advanced metrics for storage trends.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Amazon S3 Storage Lens is specifically designed for analyzing S3 storage usage, activity trends, and providing optimization recommendations. It's purpose-built for exactly the kind of analysis the company needs to perform.<br>By upgrading to the advanced metrics in S3 Storage Lens, the company gains access to 15 months of historical data, which exceeds the required 12-month analysis period mentioned in the scenario.<br>S3 Storage Lens provides contextual recommendations for cost optimization, including suggestions for appropriate storage classes based on actual usage patterns. This directly addresses the requirement to "identify the appropriate storage class for the objects."<br>The solution includes built-in interactive dashboards in the S3 console, making it easy for the solutions architect to review and analyze the data without requiring additional setup or integration with other services.<br>S3 Storage Lens allows for detailed analysis at the bucket, prefix, and account levels, providing comprehensive visibility into storage patterns across the company's entire S3 environment.<br>Option A (AWS Cost and Usage Reports with Trusted Advisor) would provide cost data but lacks the specific storage pattern analysis needed to make informed storage class decisions. While it shows what you're spending, it doesn't provide the same level of insight into object access patterns that would inform storage class decisions.<br>Option B (S3 storage class analysis with QuickSight) would require additional setup and integration with QuickSight. While it can provide useful insights, it's not as comprehensive as S3 Storage Lens for organization-wide storage analysis and doesn't include the built-in recommendations for storage class optimization.<br>Amazon S3 Storage Lens with advanced metrics is the most direct and comprehensive solution for analyzing 12 months of S3 storage trends and identifying appropriate storage classes to optimize costs.<br>Sources<br>Analyze access patterns and use the most cost-effective Amazon S3 storage class | AWS Storage Blog（https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/storage/analyze-access-patterns-and-use-the-most-cost-effective-amazon-s3-storage-class/） <br>AWS Tools for Reporting and Cost Optimization - Laying the Foundation: Setting Up Your Environment for Cost Optimization （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/aws-cost-management/cost-optimization/）<br>S3 Storage Analytics and Insights – Amazon S3 （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/s3/storage-analytics-insights/）<br>Assessing your storage activity and usage with Amazon S3 Storage Lens - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens.html）<br>Achieve cost effective cloud operations with AWS Managed Services | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/achieve-cost-effective-cloud-operations-with-aws-managed-services/）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Based on the requirements to prevent accidental deletion of important data in RDS databases or EBS volumes when a CloudFormation stack is deleted, the answer is:<br>A. Modify the CloudFormation templates to add a DeletionPolicy attribute to RDS and EBS resources.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>The DeletionPolicy attribute is specifically designed to control what happens to resources when they are removed from a CloudFormation stack or when the stack is deleted.<br>By setting DeletionPolicy to "Retain" for critical resources like RDS databases and EBS volumes, these resources will remain intact even if the CloudFormation stack is deleted.<br>Alternatively, setting DeletionPolicy to "Snapshot" would create a final snapshot before deletion, preserving the data.<br>This approach directly addresses the company's concern about data loss during stack deletion.<br>The other options are less suitable because:<br>Option B (stack policy): Stack policies control what update actions are allowed on resources within a stack, but they don't prevent the entire stack from being deleted.<br>Option C (IAM policies): While IAM policies can restrict deletion actions, they would need to be carefully crafted and maintained, and might not provide comprehensive protection against stack deletions.<br>Option D (AWS Config rules): AWS Config rules can monitor compliance but don't directly prevent deletion actions during CloudFormation stack operations.<br>Sources<br>AWS::RDS::DBInstance - AWS CloudFormation （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.html）<br>DeletionPolicy attribute - AWS CloudFormation （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html）<br>Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted - AWS CloudFormation （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html）<br>UpdateReplacePolicy attribute - AWS CloudFormation （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html）<br>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) controls - AWS Control Tower （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/rds-rules.html）<br>

<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer isB. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The question involves analyzingVPC Flow Logs to determine if inbound traffic from a public IP (`198.51.100.2`) to a private EC2 instance (with a CIDR starting with `203.0`) represents unsolicited connections. &nbsp;<br>1.VPC Flow Logs are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, not AWS CloudTrail (which is for API activity logging). So, options A and C (which suggest using CloudTrail) are incorrect. &nbsp;<br>2. The goal is to check if the private instance (`203.0.x.x`) initiated outbound traffic to `198.51.100.2` before receiving inbound traffic (indicating a response rather than unsolicited traffic). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The correct filter should look for: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; -Source IP (`srcaddr`) like `203.0` (outbound traffic from the private instance). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; -Destination IP (`dstaddr`) like `198.51.100.2` (the public IP). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - If no such traffic exists, the inbound `ACCEPT` traffic from `198.51.100.2` is likely unsolicited. &nbsp;<br>3. OptionB correctly usesCloudWatch Logs and filters for: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - `dstaddr` (destination) like `203.0` (private instance). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - `srcaddr` (source) like `198.51.100.2` (public IP). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This helps identify if the private instance sent traffic to the public IP first. &nbsp;<br>Option D is incorrect because it reverses the source and destination filters, looking for traffic where `198.51.100.2` is the destination (which is not relevant here). &nbsp;<br>Correct Answer: B<br>

<br>Based on the requirements for a cost-effective solution to query and analyze several terabytes of unstructured data in an S3 bucket, where data increases by gigabytes daily, data older than 1 year is not accessed but must be retained indefinitely, the answer is:<br>C. Use an AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon Athena to query the data. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition data that is more than 1 year old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon Athena provide a comprehensive solution for querying and analyzing large volumes of unstructured data directly from S3.

<br>The correct answer isA. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The question asks for a solution that refactors the on-premises order-processing platform in AWSwith the least operational overhead andwithout major changes to the application. &nbsp;<br>-Option A is correct because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It uses anAMI of the existing web server VM, allowing the front end to run onEC2 Auto Scaling with minimal changes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It replaces RabbitMQ withAmazon MQ (a managed RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ service), which is a direct replacement with minimal configuration. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It usesAmazon EKS (managed Kubernetes) for the backend, reducing operational overhead compared to self-managed Kubernetes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This approach requires the least modification to the existing application. &nbsp;<br>-Option B is incorrect because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Replacing the web front end withLambda and API Gateway would require significant code changes (serverless vs. VM-based). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- A custom Lambda runtime adds unnecessary complexity. &nbsp;<br>-Option C is incorrect because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It suggests installingself-managed Kubernetes on EC2, which introduces high operational overhead compared toAmazon EKS. &nbsp;<br>-Option D is incorrect because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;-Amazon SQS is not a direct replacement forRabbitMQ (which is a message broker supporting advanced protocols like AMQP).Amazon MQ is the correct managed alternative. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option A provides the most seamless migration with the least operational overhead while keeping the application mostly unchanged. &nbsp;<br>Answer: A<br>

<br>Based on the scenario where a solutions architect needs to implement client-side encryption for S3 objects using a CMK stored in AWS KMS, and is able to get existing objects but receives a "forbidden" error when trying to upload new objects, the answer is:<br>A. kms:GenerateDataKey<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>For client-side encryption of S3 objects using AWS KMS, the client application needs to generate a data key from the CMK.<br>The kms:GenerateDataKey permission is specifically required to request a unique data key from KMS, which is then used to encrypt the object locally before uploading to S3.<br>Without this permission, the client cannot obtain the necessary data key to perform the encryption, resulting in the "forbidden" error message when attempting to upload new objects.<br>Since the solutions architect can already get existing objects, the IAM policy likely already includes permissions for operations like kms:Decrypt, but is missing the crucial permission needed for the encryption of new objects.<br>The other options are not correct for this specific scenario:<br>kms:GetKeyPolicy (option B) is used to view a key policy, not for encryption operations<br>kms:GetPublicKey (option C) is used for asymmetric keys to retrieve the public key, not for generating data keys<br>kms:Sign (option D) is used for digital signatures, not for encryption of S3 objects<br>Sources<br>Specifying dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS) - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-dsse-encryption.html）<br>Using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) in directory buckets - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-UsingKMSEncryption.html）<br>Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets - Amazon Simple Storage Service（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html） <br>Amazon S3 Express One Zone now supports AWS KMS with customer managed keys | AWS News Blog（https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-express-one-zone-now-supports-aws-kms-with-customer-managed-keys/） <br>Understanding Amazon S3 client-side encryption options | AWS Storage Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/storage/understanding-amazon-s3-client-side-encryption-options/）<br>How to encrypt your object in S3 | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUa2uGgWvVTeCAkp6vKHBmdw/how-to-encrypt-your-object-in-s3）<br>

<br>The correct answer isC. &nbsp;<br>Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The requirement is to distribute common CIDR ranges across all AWS accounts with theleast operational overhead. Here’s whyOption C is the best solution: &nbsp;<br>1.Centralized Management: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Acustomer-managed prefix list is created in thesecurity team’s AWS account, which acts as a single source of truth for CIDR ranges. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Instead of manually updating each account, the security team only needs to update thisone prefix list. &nbsp;<br>2.Shared Across the Organization: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - UsingAWS Resource Access Manager (RAM), the prefix list isshared with all accounts in the organization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This avoids duplication and ensures consistency. &nbsp;<br>3.Reduced Operational Overhead: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Developers in each account only need toreference the shared prefix list in their security groups (instead of manually updating IPs). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The security teamdoes not need to notify each account owner for every change—they just update the prefix list, and all accounts automatically get the latest CIDRs. &nbsp;<br>Why Other Options Are Less Optimal: &nbsp;<br>-Option A: Requires deploying Lambda functions in every account and manual SNS notifications. This increases operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>-Option B: Requires creating and maintaining separate prefix lists ineach account, which is redundant and harder to manage. &nbsp;<br>-Option D: Requires Lambda to assume roles in every account and update security groups directly, which is complex and increases operational risk. &nbsp;<br>Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option C is themost scalable and least operationally intensive solution, as it centralizes CIDR management and leverages AWS RAM for easy sharing. &nbsp;<br>Answer: C<br>

<br>Based on the requirements for a cost-effective AWS Client VPN solution that allows remote employees to access internal applications hosted in VPCs across multiple AWS accounts, the answer is:<br>B. Create a Client VPN endpoint in the main AWS account. Configure required routing that allows access to internal applications.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Creating a single Client VPN endpoint in the main AWS account is more cost-effective than deploying multiple endpoints across different accounts. AWS Client VPN pricing is based on the number of endpoints and connections, so consolidating to one endpoint reduces costs.<br>Since the VPC in the main AWS account already has peering connections established with VPCs in other AWS accounts, you can leverage this existing network architecture. The Client VPN endpoint can route traffic through these peering connections to reach resources in all connected VPCs.<br>This approach simplifies management and configuration by centralizing the VPN solution in one account rather than managing multiple endpoints across different accounts.<br>The required routing can be configured to allow access to all internal applications across the peered VPCs, meeting the requirement for employees to access applications in multiple AWS accounts.<br>Option A (creating a Client VPN endpoint in each AWS account) would be more complex to manage and significantly more expensive due to the additional endpoints, making it less cost-effective than the centralized approach in option B.<br>Sources<br>Client VPN with VPC peering vs Client VPN withTransit gateway | AWS re:Post (https://repost.aws/questions/QUUotXjy2mTV6noMA-J86AXQ/client-vpn-with-vpc-peering-vs-client-vpn-withtransit-gateway)<br>VPN &nbsp;- Building a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpn.html)<br>Software remote access-to-Amazon VPC connectivity options - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/software-remote-access-to-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.html)<br>How AWS Client VPN works - AWS Client VPN (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/how-it-works.html)<br>

Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to store events and invoke the Lambda function.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Amazon SQS provides a reliable message queuing service that effectively decouples components of a distributed application, which directly addresses the requirement to decouple the third-party service calls.<br>SQS ensures that all messages (service calls) are eventually processed, even if there are temporary failures or throttling from the third-party services, meeting the requirement that "all calls are eventually completed."<br>SQS acts as a buffer that can absorb traffic spikes and allows the Lambda function to process messages at a consistent rate, which helps address the inconsistent response times issue.<br>SQS offers features like visibility timeout and dead-letter queues that provide robust error handling and retry mechanisms for failed processing attempts.<br>The other options are less suitable for this specific scenario:<br>Option B (AWS Step Functions): While good for orchestrating complex workflows, it's more suited for coordinating multiple steps rather than simple decoupling of service calls.<br>Option C (Amazon EventBridge): Better for event routing based on patterns rather than ensuring eventual completion of all calls.<br>Option D (Amazon SNS): Primarily designed for pub/sub messaging and fanout patterns, SNS doesn't store messages for later processing if the consumer is unavailable, making it less suitable for ensuring all calls are eventually completed.<br>Sources<br>Capturing records of Lambda asynchronous invocations - AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html）<br>Transforming Order Fulfillment with Event-Driven Architecture: A Rapid7 Success Story | AWS Partner Network (APN) Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/apn/transforming-order-fulfillment-with-event-driven-architecture-a-rapid7-success-story/）<br>Creating event-driven architectures with Lambda - AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concepts-event-driven-architectures.html）<br>Application integration services - Amazon Simple Notification Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-event-sources-application-integration.html）<br>Field Notes: Orchestrating and Monitoring Complex, Long-running Workflows Using AWS Step Functions | AWS Architecture Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/architecture/field-notes-orchestrating-and-monitoring-complex-long-running-workflows-using-aws-step-functions/）<br>

To provide secure access to the S3 bucket across AWS accounts with the least operational overhead, I recommend the following solution:<br>1. Create a cross-account IAM role in the sales team's AWS account:<br>   - This role should grant access to the S3 bucket and the KMS key used for encryption.<br>   - The trust policy should allow the marketing team's AWS account to assume this role.<br>2. Update the existing IAM service role for QuickSight in the marketing team's account:<br>   - Add permissions to assume the cross-account role created in step 1.<br>3. Configure QuickSight in the marketing team's account:<br>   - Set up a new data source using the cross-account role to access the S3 bucket.<br>4. (Optional) Use AWS Lake Formation for fine-grained access control:<br>   - If more granular control over data access is needed, consider implementing Lake Formation.<br>This solution provides several benefits:<br>- Minimal operational overhead: Leverages existing QuickSight setup and requires minimal new resources.<br>- Secure: Maintains the principle of least privilege by using cross-account roles.<br>- Scalable: Can easily accommodate future needs for data sharing between accounts.<br>Best practices to consider:<br>- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to ensure they remain appropriate.<br>- Use condition keys in the IAM policies to further restrict access (e.g., by IP range or time of day).<br>- Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log access to the S3 bucket and KMS key.<br>- Implement a process for regular rotation of the KMS key used for S3 bucket encryption.<br>Remember to test this setup in a non-production environment before implementing it in production. Also, consult the AWS documentation for the most up-to-date information on cross-account access and QuickSight configuration.<br>Sources<br>[1] [Example 4 - Bucket owner granting cross-account permission to objects it does not own - Amazon Simple Storage Service] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example4.html)<br>[3] [Community | AWS Cross Account S3 Access Through Lambda Functions] (https://community.aws/content/2cCcsg05ZX2PoMHwMcWhv2BMlPL/aws-cross-account-s3-access-through-lambda-functions)<br>[6] [Configure IAM roles - AWS Transfer Family] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/webapp-roles.html)<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">ACE</span>
<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>A, C, E &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Design Team Access: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The design team (in the development account) needs read/write access to a specific S3 bucket in the production account. &nbsp;<br>2. Least Privilege: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Restrict access only to the S3 bucket (no other production resources). &nbsp;<br>3. Security: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Avoid sharing production account credentials. &nbsp;<br> Correct Steps (A, C, E): &nbsp;<br>1. A (Production Account - IAM Policy for S3): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Create a policy in the production account granting `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, etc., only for the target bucket. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```json<br> &nbsp; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Statement": [{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::production-bucket/*"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; }]<br> &nbsp; }<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. C (Production Account - Role with Trust): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Create an IAM role in the production account, attach the policy from A, and trust the development account. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```json<br> &nbsp; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Statement": [{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::DevelopmentAccountID:root" },<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; }]<br> &nbsp; }<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>3. E (Development Account - Group with AssumeRole): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Create a group for the design team in the development account and attach a policy allowing `sts:AssumeRole` on the production account’s role. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```json<br> &nbsp; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Statement": [{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ProductionAccountID:role/DesignTeamRole"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; }]<br> &nbsp; }<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Policy in Dev Account): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Policies in the dev account can’t grant access to production resources. &nbsp;<br>- D (Role in Dev Account): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Roles in the dev account can’t access production S3 directly. &nbsp;<br>- F (AssumeRole on Dev Role): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t solve cross-account access. &nbsp;<br> Workflow: &nbsp;<br>1. Design team members (in dev account) assume the production role. &nbsp;<br>2. AWS grants temporary credentials to upload/download S3 assets. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A, C, E is the secure, least-privilege solution for cross-account S3 access. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>C. Modify the existing environment’s capacity configuration to use a load-balanced environment type. Select all Availability Zones. Add a scale-out rule that will run if the average CPU utilization is over 85% for 5 minutes. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Performance Bottleneck: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - High CPU utilization (&gt;85%) in the single-instance Elastic Beanstalk environment. &nbsp;<br>2. Production Readiness: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Need scalability (auto-scaling) and high availability (multi-AZ). &nbsp;<br>3. Least Operational Overhead: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Avoid recreating the application or managing multiple environments. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Convert to Load-Balanced Environment: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Upgrades the existing single-instance environment to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Auto-scaling group (handles CPU spikes). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Multi-AZ deployment (improves availability). &nbsp;<br>- Auto-Scaling Rule: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Scales out when CPU &gt;85% for 5 minutes (matches observed bottleneck). &nbsp;<br>- Minimal Changes: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No need to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Rebuild the app (unlike Option D). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Split traffic manually (unlike Option B). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Create a new app (unlike Option A). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>- A (New Application): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Redundant: Requires redeploying the app to a new environment. &nbsp;<br>- B (Traffic Splitting): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Complex: Manages two environments and splits traffic (not true auto-scaling). &nbsp;<br>- D (Rebuild Environment): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Risky: "Rebuild" may cause downtime; also only selects one AZ (not highly available). &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. In Elastic Beanstalk console: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Go to Configuration → Capacity. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Change Environment type to "Load balanced". &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Enable all Availability Zones. &nbsp;<br>2. Add auto-scaling rule: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Metric: CPUUtilization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Threshold: 85% for 5 minutes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Action: Add instances. &nbsp;<br> Cost Consideration: &nbsp;<br>- Load balancer + multi-AZ adds cost but is necessary for production. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>C provides the simplest, most reliable path to production readiness with auto-scaling. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>C. In the AWS Billing and Cost Management console, use the organization’s management account to turn off RI Sharing for the HR department’s production AWS account. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Restrict RI Discount Sharing: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - HR’s Reserved Instances (RIs) should only apply to their production account. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Prevent other departments (Finance, Sales, etc.) from benefiting from the discounts. &nbsp;<br>2. AWS Organizations Context: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The company uses consolidated billing with multiple OUs/departments. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - By default, RIs are shared across all accounts in an organization. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- RI Sharing Settings: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Only the management account of an AWS Organization can disable RI sharing. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Navigate to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;AWS Billing Console → Preferences → Disable "RI Discount Sharing" for the HR production account. &nbsp;<br>- Effect: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- HR’s RIs will only discount their production account’s usage. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Other departments’ accounts cannot use the discounts. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>- A (HR Account Console): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Individual accounts cannot modify RI sharing—only the management account can. &nbsp;<br>- B (Remove Account from Org): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overkill: Loses OU benefits (e.g., SCPs, centralized logging). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t block sharing: RIs are still account-specific unless sharing is disabled. &nbsp;<br>- D (SCP to Block RI Access): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- SCPs can’t control RI sharing—they only deny permissions, not billing behaviors. &nbsp;<br> How RI Sharing Works: &nbsp;<br>| Setting &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Default (Enabled) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Disabled (Option C) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;<br>|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------| &nbsp;<br>| RI Discount Scope &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| All linked accounts in the Org &nbsp;| Only the purchasing account &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;<br>| Management Required? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | No &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Yes (management account only) &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>To ensure HR’s RIs aren’t shared, C is the only valid solution via the management account’s billing console. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>D. Suspend the Auto Scaling group’s Terminate process. Use Session Manager to log in to an instance that is marked as unhealthy. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Troubleshoot Unhealthy Instances: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - EC2 instances are being marked unhealthy and terminated before investigation. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Need to preserve an unhealthy instance for debugging. &nbsp;<br>2. Access Method: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Session Manager is already configured (SSH/RDP not required). &nbsp;<br>3. Minimal Disruption: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Avoid affecting healthy instances or application availability. &nbsp;<br> Why Option D is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- Suspend Terminate Process: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Temporarily stops Auto Scaling from terminating unhealthy instances. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Allows time to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Use Session Manager to access the instance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Check logs/processes (`/var/log/`, `systemctl status`). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Identify root cause (e.g., failed health checks, app crashes). &nbsp;<br>- Safe and Reversible: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Resume termination after debugging. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>- A (Suspend HealthCheck): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t prevent termination—unhealthy instances will still be replaced. &nbsp;<br>- B (Termination Protection): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 termination protection doesn’t block Auto Scaling terminations. &nbsp;<br>- C (OldestInstance Policy): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t preserve unhealthy instances—only affects which instance is terminated first. &nbsp;<br> Steps to Implement: &nbsp;<br>1. Suspend Terminate Process: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws autoscaling suspend-processes --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --scaling-processes Terminate<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. Access Instance via Session Manager: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws ssm start-session --target i-1234567890abcdef0<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>3. Resume After Debugging: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws autoscaling resume-processes --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --scaling-processes Terminate<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br> Common Root Causes for Unhealthy Instances: &nbsp;<br>- Application crashes (check `journalctl -u &lt;service&gt;`). &nbsp;<br>- Failed ALB health checks (check `/var/log/nginx/error.log`). &nbsp;<br>- Resource exhaustion (`top`, `df -h`). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>D is the only option that lets you inspect unhealthy instances before termination, minimizing downtime. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

Use an Amazon EventBridge rule to identify any changes to the parameter and to invoke an AWS Lambda function to update the security policy in the Firewall Manager administrative account. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Centralized AWS WAF Management: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Deploy and manage WAF rules across multiple accounts/OUs in AWS Organizations. &nbsp;<br>2. Dynamic Account/OU Management: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Add or remove accounts/OUs from WAF rule sets without manual updates. &nbsp;<br>3. Automated Remediation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Detect and fix noncompliant WAF rules automatically. &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Best? &nbsp;<br>- AWS Firewall Manager: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Native AWS service for managing WAF rules across accounts in an organization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Supports automatic remediation of noncompliant resources. &nbsp;<br>- Systems Manager Parameter Store: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Stores account/OU lists dynamically (easy to update). &nbsp;<br>- EventBridge + Lambda: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Triggers policy updates when accounts/OUs are added/removed (low overhead). &nbsp;<br> Workflow: &nbsp;<br>1. Firewall Manager Admin Account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Defines WAF rule sets and target OUs/accounts. &nbsp;<br>2. Parameter Store: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Maintains a list of managed accounts/OUs (e.g., `/firewall-manager/targets`). &nbsp;<br>3. EventBridge Rule: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Monitors Parameter Store for changes → invokes Lambda to update Firewall Manager policies. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>- B (AWS Config + CloudFormation Stack Sets): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No centralized WAF management (manual stack updates required). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS Config rules cannot enforce WAF associations. &nbsp;<br>- C (Lambda + Cross-Account Roles): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- High overhead: Custom code to manage WAF rules (no native automation). &nbsp;<br>- D (AWS Control Tower + KMS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Control Tower doesn’t manage WAF rules directly. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- KMS is not designed for account/OU tracking. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1.

Option A is the correct answer as it leverages IAM database authentication for the Aurora DB cluster, which eliminates the need to store and manage database credentials in the Lambda environment variables. By deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, data transfers to S3 are kept within the AWS network, reducing the risk of data exposure over the internet. This solution provides both security and compliance benefits by using AWS managed services and features.

<br>Option C is the correct answer as it involves creating a custom IAM policy that restricts the instance types that developers can launch. By specifying allowed instance types in the policy and attaching it to an IAM group associated with the developers, the company can enforce cost optimization and prevent the use of non-compliant instance types. This approach provides direct control over resource usage and aligns with the principle of least privilege.<br>C. Create a new IAM policy. Specify the instance types that are allowed. Attach the policy to an IAM group that contains the IAM accounts for the developers. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Limit EC2 Instance Types: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Restrict developers to specific instance types (e.g., t3.medium, t3.large). &nbsp;<br>2. Cost Control: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Prevent use of large/expensive instances (e.g., m5.24xlarge). &nbsp;<br>3. Alignment with Well-Architected Framework: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Cost Optimization: Enforce least-privilege resource provisioning. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- IAM Policy Granular Control: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Create a policy that denies `ec2:RunInstances` for all instance types except approved ones: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;```json<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Statement": [<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Effect": "Deny",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Action": "ec2:RunInstances",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Condition": {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"StringNotEquals": {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"ec2:InstanceType": ["t3.medium", "t3.large"]<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;``` &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Attach to the developers’ IAM group (centralized management). &nbsp;<br>- Advantages: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No manual oversight (automatically enforced). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No infrastructure changes (unlike launch templates/Image Builder). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>- A (AWS Config Rule): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Reactive: Only detects noncompliant instances after creation (doesn’t prevent launch). &nbsp;<br>- B (Launch Template): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Easily bypassed: Developers can ignore templates and launch instances directly. &nbsp;<br>- D (EC2 Image Builder): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t restrict instance types (only standardizes AMIs). &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>A. Create an AWS Config rule in each account to find resources with missing tags. <br>B. Create an SCP in the organization with a deny action for ec2:RunInstances if the Project tag is missing. <br>E. Create an AWS Config aggregator for the organization to collect a list of EC2 instances with the missing Project tag.<br>These three actions together provide a comprehensive solution to both resolve the current issue and prevent it from happening in the future:<br>AWS Config rules in each account (option A) will help identify existing EC2 instances that are missing the required Project tag. This addresses the immediate problem of finding resources that need to be tagged.<br>Creating an SCP with a deny action for ec2:RunInstances if the Project tag is missing (option B) is a preventive measure that ensures all new EC2 instances will have the required tag. This prevents the problem from recurring in the future by enforcing the tagging policy at the organization level.<br>Setting up an AWS Config aggregator (option E) provides centralized visibility across all accounts in the organization. This allows the team responsible for all AWS accounts to monitor compliance with tagging policies across the entire organization from a single location.<br>Together, these actions create a robust solution that addresses both the current missing tags and prevents future instances from being created without proper cost allocation tags.<br>Sources<br>Building a cost allocation strategy - Best Practices for Tagging AWS Resources （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/building-a-cost-allocation-strategy.html）<br>Implementing and enforcing tagging - Best Practices for Tagging AWS Resources （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/implementing-and-enforcing-tagging.html）<br>AWS Organizations – Tag policies - Best Practices for Tagging AWS Resources （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/aws-organizations-tag-policies.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
Option D is the correct choice as it involves adding a VPC endpoint for Kinesis Data Streams, which allows applications to access the service without going through the internet gateway or NAT gateway, thus reducing costs associated with NAT gateway usage. The VPC endpoint policy ensures that only the necessary traffic from the applications is allowed, which helps maintain the function of the applications while optimizing for cost.

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>D. Create a transit VIF from the DX-A connection into a Direct Connect gateway. Create a transit VIF from the DX-B connection into the same Direct Connect gateway for high availability. Associate both the eu-west-1 and us-east-1 transit gateways with this Direct Connect gateway. Peer the transit gateways with each other to support cross-Region routing. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Hybrid Connectivity: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - On-premises (Europe) → AWS (eu-west-1 + us-east-1). &nbsp;<br>2. Inter-Region VPC Routing: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Direct traffic between eu-west-1 and us-east-1 VPCs. &nbsp;<br>3. High Availability (No SPOF): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Leverage two Direct Connect (DX) connections (DX-A + DX-B). &nbsp;<br> Why Option D is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- Transit VIFs + Direct Connect Gateway: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Transit VIFs (from DX-A/DX-B) connect to a single Direct Connect gateway. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Direct Connect gateway associates with both Transit Gateways (eu-west-1 + us-east-1). &nbsp;<br>- Transit Gateway Peering: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Enables cross-region VPC routing (eu-west-1 ↔ us-east-1). &nbsp;<br>- High Availability: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Two DX connections → no single point of failure. &nbsp;<br> Architecture Flow: &nbsp;<br>1. On-Premises → AWS: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Traffic flows via DX-A/DX-B → Direct Connect gateway → Transit Gateways. &nbsp;<br>2. Inter-Region (eu-west-1 ↔ us-east-1): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Transit Gateway peering routes traffic directly. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Private VIFs): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Private VIFs only work with VPCs, not Transit Gateways. &nbsp;<br>- B (Separate Direct Connect Gateways): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No cross-region routing: Direct Connect gateways cannot peer with each other. &nbsp;<br>- C (Direct Connect Gateway Routing): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Direct Connect gateways don’t route between Transit Gateways (peering is required). &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. Create Transit VIFs: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws directconnect create-transit-virtual-interface --connection-id dxcon-xxxx --vlan 100 --direct-connect-gateway-id dgw-xxxx<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2.

The correct answer is B. Creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that runs every business day in the evening to stop instances and another rule that runs every business day in the morning to start instances based on the tag will reduce costs with the least operational effort. This approach allows for instances to be stopped during non-business hours when they are not in use, reducing the costs associated with running them. It also allows for instances to be started again in the morning when the development and testing teams need to use them.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. The company reached its API Gateway account limit for calls per second.<br>This is the most likely cause of the error messages because:<br>The error response "429 Too Many Requests" is occurring across multiple API methods during peak usage hours, suggesting a broader throttling issue rather than a method-specific one.<br>The Lambda function is never invoked, which indicates that the requests are being throttled at the API Gateway level before they even reach the Lambda integration.<br>API Gateway has default account-level throttling limits that apply across all APIs in an account within a specific Region. These account limits are separate from and take precedence over any method-level limits.<br>Since the company has premium tier customers allowed to make up to 3,000 calls per second, and these customers are distributed across various Regions, the combined traffic during peak hours is likely exceeding the default account-level throttling limits in those Regions.<br>Option D (reaching the default per-method limit) is less likely to be the cause because:<br>If it were a per-method limit issue, we would expect to see the problem only on specific methods, not across multiple methods.<br>The company has likely configured higher method-level limits for premium tier customers, but these custom limits would still be constrained by the overall account-level limits.<br>To resolve this issue, the company should request an increase to their API Gateway account-level throttling limits in the affected Regions through AWS Support.<br>Sources<br>REL05-BP02 Throttle requests - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_throttle_requests.html）<br>Throttle requests to your REST APIs for better throughput in API Gateway - Amazon API Gateway （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-request-throttling.html）<br><br><br>

<br><br><br> Answer: &nbsp;<br>A. Deploy the security tool on EC2 instances in a new Auto Scaling group in the existing VPC. &nbsp;<br>D. Provision a Gateway Load Balancer for each Availability Zone to redirect the traffic to the security tool. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Real-Time Traffic Inspection: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - All inbound/outbound VPC traffic must be inspected by the legacy security tool. &nbsp;<br>2. High Availability: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Solution must be resilient within a single AWS Region. &nbsp;<br>3. No Performance Impact: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Inspection must not degrade application performance. &nbsp;<br>4. Legacy Tool Integration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The security tool has no cloud-native version (must run on EC2). &nbsp;<br> Why A + D? &nbsp;<br>- Gateway Load Balancer (D): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Traffic Mirroring: Redirects all VPC traffic to security tool instances. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- High Availability: Deploy one per AZ (ensures redundancy). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No Performance Hit: Operates at line speed (unlike inline proxies). &nbsp;<br>- Security Tool on EC2 (A): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Auto Scaling group ensures tool availability. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Same VPC avoids cross-VPC latency. &nbsp;<br> Architecture Flow: &nbsp;<br>1. Inbound Traffic: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Internet → Gateway Load Balancer → Security Tool EC2 Instances → Web Application EC2. &nbsp;<br>2. Outbound Traffic: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Web Application EC2 → Gateway Load Balancer → Security Tool EC2 Instances → Internet. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Network Load Balancer): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t enable traffic inspection (passes traffic directly to apps). &nbsp;<br>- C (Application Load Balancer): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- L7 only: Can’t inspect raw packets (security tool needs L3/L4). &nbsp;<br>- E (Transit Gateway): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Irrelevant: No multi-VPC requirement. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. Deploy Gateway Load Balancer: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws ec2 create-load-balancer --type gateway --name my-gwlb --subnets subnet-123456 subnet-789012<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. Register Security Tool Targets: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws ec2 register-targets --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:targetgroup/my-gwlb-tg/1234567890123456 --targets Id=i-1234567890abcdef0<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>3. Update VPC Route Tables: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Route 0.0.0.0/0 to the Gateway Load Balancer. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A + D is the only combination that: &nbsp;<br>- Integrates the legacy tool (EC2-based). &nbsp;<br>- Inspects all traffic (Gateway LB). &nbsp;<br>- Ensures high availability. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>The correct answer is D. By creating an Amazon ECS cluster on AWS Fargate and using the AWS CLI run-task command with enableECSManagedTags set to true, the company can launch the planning application with the least operational overhead. This approach allows for serverless container management, as Fargate handles the underlying infrastructure. Additionally, using tags with ECS tasks helps in managing and tracking costs effectively.<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>D. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster on AWS Fargate. Use the AWS CLI run-task command and set enableECSManagedTags to true to launch the planning application. Use the --tags option to assign a custom tag to the task. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Cost-Effective Resource Allocation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Pay only for running containers (no idle EC2 costs). &nbsp;<br>2. Custom Configuration per Section: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Each delivery area section needs dedicated containers with unique settings. &nbsp;<br>3. Least Operational Overhead: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Avoid managing servers (e.g., EC2 nodes, Kubernetes control plane). &nbsp;<br> Why Option D is Best? &nbsp;<br>- ECS on Fargate: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Serverless: No EC2 management; scales containers automatically. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Cost-Efficient: Billed per vCPU/memory used (no over-provisioning). &nbsp;<br>- Task Tags: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Use `--tags` to label tasks by delivery section (e.g., `section=North`). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Enables cost tracking per section via AWS Cost Explorer. &nbsp;<br>- Simplified CLI Deployment: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;```bash<br> &nbsp;aws ecs run-task \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;--cluster route-planning \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;--task-definition planner-task \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;--enable-ecs-managed-tags \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;--tags "key=section,value=North"<br> &nbsp;``` &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A/B (EKS on EC2/Fargate): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overkill: Kubernetes adds complexity (no need for multi-cloud/advanced orchestration). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EKS CLI not required (ECS CLI is simpler). &nbsp;<br>- C (ECS on EC2): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 overhead: Must manage nodes/scaling (violates "least operational overhead"). &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>A. The IPv4 CIDR ranges of the two VPCs overlap <br>E. The IAM role in the peer accepter account does not have the correct permissions<br>These two factors could cause the VPC peering failure for the following reasons:<br>CIDR overlap (option A): The application VPC has a CIDR block of 10.10.0.0/16, while the shared services VPC has a CIDR block of 10.10.10.0/24. The shared services VPC CIDR (10.10.10.0/24) is completely contained within the application VPC CIDR (10.10.0.0/16), creating an overlap. AWS VPC peering explicitly prohibits connecting VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks, as this would create routing ambiguity.<br>IAM permissions (option E): When creating a VPC peering connection between accounts, the user or role in the accepter account must have the appropriate permissions to accept the peering request. If the IAM role being used in the CloudFormation template doesn't have these permissions, the peering creation will fail.<br>Option B (different regions) is not correct because AWS supports inter-region VPC peering, allowing VPCs in different regions to be peered together.<br>Option C (Internet gateway access) is not correct because VPC peering doesn't require either VPC to have access to an Internet gateway. VPC peering creates a direct network connection between the VPCs and operates independently of Internet access.<br>Option D (AWS Resource Access Manager) is not correct because RAM is used for sharing resources like subnets within a VPC, not for VPC peering. VPC peering is established using the VPC peering feature, not through RAM.<br>Sources<br>how to Connect VPCs with Overlapping CIDRs Across Accounts | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU0z4ZmjEESRuDr1K1_ZYjYw/how-to-connect-vpcs-with-overlapping-cidrs-across-accounts）<br>prerequisites to ensure vpc peering | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUkDFWtBUlQfyETl1h5Z2skw/prerequisites-to-ensure-vpc-peering）<br>Troubleshoot a VPC peering connection - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/troubleshoot-vpc-peering-connections.html）<br>

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>B. Turn on AWS CloudTrail logging for the AWS account. Use AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer to generate IAM access policies based on the activity recorded in the CloudTrail log. Review the generated policies to ensure that they meet the company's business requirements. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Least-Privilege Permissions: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Each Lambda function should have only the permissions it actually uses. &nbsp;<br>2. Least Effort: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Avoid manual analysis or custom scripting. &nbsp;<br>3. Audit Trail: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Use existing logs to identify used permissions. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- IAM Access Analyzer: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Automatically analyzes CloudTrail logs to generate least-privilege policies. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Policy Generation: Creates IAM policies based on actual API calls made by Lambda functions. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No Custom Code: Fully managed service (no EMR/scripts needed). &nbsp;<br>- Steps: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;1. Enable CloudTrail (if not already on). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;2. Run Access Analyzer to generate policies. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;3.

Enable CloudTrail: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws cloudtrail create-trail --name LambdaAudit --s3-bucket-name my-log-bucket<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. Generate Policies with Access Analyzer: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Navigate to IAM → Access Analyzer → Policy Generation. &nbsp;<br>3. Apply Policies: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws iam put-role-policy --role-name LambdaExecutionRole --policy-name LeastPrivilege --policy-document file://policy.json<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the fastest, most accurate way to enforce least privilege: &nbsp;<br>- Automated policy generation (Access Analyzer). &nbsp;<br>- No manual analysis (unlike scripting/EMR). &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>B. In the application account, create an IAM role that is named DBA-Secret. Grant the role the required permissions to access the secrets. In the DBA account, create an IAM role that is named DBA-Admin. Grant the DBA-Admin role the required permissions to assume the DBA-Secret role in the application account. Attach the DBA-Admin role to the EC2 instance for access to the cross-account secrets. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Cross-Account Secret Access: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - DBAs (in DBA account) need access to Secrets Manager secrets (in application account). &nbsp;<br>2. No Manual Sharing: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Eliminate manual credential sharing. &nbsp;<br>3. Security: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Secrets encrypted with AWS managed key (no custom KMS policy changes needed). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- IAM Role Delegation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;1. Application Account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Create `DBA-Secret` role with `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Trust policy allows `DBA-Admin` role (from DBA account) to assume it. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; ```json<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Statement": [{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::DBA_ACCOUNT_ID:role/DBA-Admin" },<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }]<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;2. DBA Account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Attach `DBA-Admin` role to EC2 instance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Role has `sts:AssumeRole` permission for `DBA-Secret`. &nbsp;<br>- Workflow: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 instance (DBA account) → Assumes `DBA-Secret` role → Accesses secrets. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (AWS RAM Sharing): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Secrets Manager doesn’t support cross-account sharing via RAM. &nbsp;<br>- C (KMS Key Policies): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overkill: AWS managed keys already allow cross-account access via IAM roles. &nbsp;<br>- D (SCP Allow): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- SCPs cannot grant permissions (only deny). &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. In Application Account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws iam create-role --role-name DBA-Secret --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json<br> &nbsp; aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name DBA-Secret --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. In DBA Account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws iam create-role --role-name DBA-Admin --assume-role-policy-document file://ec2-trust-policy.json<br> &nbsp; aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name DBA-Admin --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>3. On EC2 Instance: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::APPLICATION_ACCOUNT_ID:role/DBA-Secret --role-session-name DBASession<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the only secure, scalable solution that: &nbsp;<br>- Automates secret access (no manual sharing). &nbsp;<br>- Uses IAM roles (no KMS/S3/SCP workarounds). &nbsp;<br>- Aligns with AWS best practices. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use AWS Fargate to run the application. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke the Fargate task every 4 hours.<br>This is the best strategy for the solutions architect to revise the architecture for the following reasons:<br>AWS Fargate is well-suited for this workload because:<br>It can easily handle the 2GB RAM requirement and CPU-intensive workload<br>It supports containerized applications, which is perfect for packaging the Linux binary<br>It can run for more than 20 minutes without any time limitations<br>It's serverless, which means you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure<br>Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) provides a reliable way to schedule the task to run every 4 hours.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. AWS Lambda has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, which is insufficient for an application that runs for up to 20 minutes. Also, CloudWatch Logs is not designed to invoke Lambda functions on a schedule.<br>B. AWS Batch would work for this workload, but it's more complex to set up and manage compared to Fargate for this relatively simple scheduling requirement. It's designed for more complex batch processing scenarios with dependencies and job queues.<br>D. Amazon EC2 Spot Instances could be interrupted during processing, which would disrupt the ETL job. Additionally, AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service, not a scheduling tool, so it's not appropriate for invoking the application on a regular schedule.<br>AWS Fargate with EventBridge scheduling provides the right balance of simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for this stateless ETL application.<br>Sources<br>AWS Fargate or AWS Lambda? - AWS Fargate or AWS Lambda? （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/decision-guides/latest/fargate-or-lambda/fargate-or-lambda.html）<br>REL05-BP06 Make services stateless where possible - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-10-03/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_stateless.html）<br>

To meet the requirements of reduced latency, improved reliability, and minimal implementation effort, the solutions architect should choose Option C. This option involves creating an additional S3 bucket in a new Region and setting up S3 Cross-Region Replication to serve game assets globally while reducing latency. Additionally, using Amazon CloudFront with origin failover provides high availability for the game assets. Setting up DynamoDB global tables with a replica in a new Region ensures reliability and fast access to player scores worldwide.

Deploy Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones for the Java backend application. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. No Application Changes: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Must retain MongoDB compatibility (cannot switch to Aurora). &nbsp;<br>2. High Availability: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Database and backend must be multi-AZ. &nbsp;<br>3. Managed Services Preferred: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Minimize operational overhead where possible. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Amazon DocumentDB: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Fully compatible with MongoDB (no app changes needed). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Built-in multi-AZ replication (automated failover). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Managed service (no EC2 patching/scaling). &nbsp;<br>- EC2 Auto Scaling: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Multi-AZ deployment ensures backend availability. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No code changes (Java app runs as-is). &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Aurora): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires app changes (MongoDB → Aurora SQL). &nbsp;<br>- B (MongoDB on EC2): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Single-AZ risk (violates high availability). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Self-managed (operational overhead). &nbsp;<br>- D (DocumentDB On-Demand): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- On-demand is cost-prohibitive for steady workloads. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Provisioned capacity (Option C) is more cost-effective. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1.

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>A. Create a bucket policy that includes read permissions for the S3 bucket. Set the principal of the bucket policy to the account ID of the Strategy account. &nbsp;<br>C. Update the custom KMS key policy in the Creative account to grant decrypt permissions to the strategy_reviewer IAM role. &nbsp;<br>F. Update the strategy_reviewer IAM role to grant read permissions for the S3 bucket and to grant decrypt permissions for the custom KMS key. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Cross-Account S3 Access: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Strategy team (Strategy account) needs read-only access to S3 bucket (Creative account). &nbsp;<br>2. KMS Encryption: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Bucket uses a custom KMS key (requires decrypt permissions). &nbsp;<br>3. Least Privilege: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Grant only `s3:GetObject` and `kms:Decrypt`. &nbsp;<br> Why A + C + F? &nbsp;<br>- A (Bucket Policy): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Grants read access to the Strategy account (principal = Strategy account ID). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;```json<br> &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Statement": [{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::STRATEGY_ACCOUNT_ID:root" },<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Action": ["s3:GetObject"],<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::creative-bucket/*"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}]<br> &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp;``` &nbsp;<br>- C (KMS Key Policy): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Allows `kms:Decrypt` for the `strategy_reviewer` role (required for encrypted objects). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;```json<br> &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::STRATEGY_ACCOUNT_ID:role/strategy_reviewer" },<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Action": "kms:Decrypt",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Resource": "*"<br> &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp;``` &nbsp;<br>- F (IAM Role Permissions): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Attach inline policy to `strategy_reviewer` role: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;```json<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Version": "2012-10-17",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Statement": [<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Action": ["s3:GetObject"],<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::creative-bucket/*"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Effect": "Allow",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Action": "kms:Decrypt",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:CREATIVE_ACCOUNT_ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;``` &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Full S3/KMS Permissions): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Violates least privilege (`s3:*` is excessive). &nbsp;<br>- D (Anonymous Access): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Security risk (public access to sensitive data). &nbsp;<br>- E (Encrypt Permission): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Strategy team doesn’t need `kms:Encrypt` (only `Decrypt`). &nbsp;<br> Access Flow: &nbsp;<br>1. Strategy user assumes `strategy_reviewer` role. &nbsp;<br>2. Role permissions allow `s3:GetObject` + `kms:Decrypt`. &nbsp;<br>3. Bucket policy permits access from Strategy account. &nbsp;<br>4.

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>C. Use AWS DataSync to transfer the sequencing data to Amazon S3. Use S3 events to trigger an AWS Lambda function that starts an AWS Step Functions workflow. Store the Docker images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and trigger AWS Batch to run the container and process the sequencing data. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. High-Volume Data Transfer: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - 200 GB per genome (10-15 jobs/day = 2–3 TB/day). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Direct Connect available (prioritize fast, reliable transfers). &nbsp;<br>2. Scalable Compute: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Jobs take hours to process (need burstable, high-performance compute). &nbsp;<br>3. Workflow Automation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Reduce turnaround time from weeks to days. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- AWS DataSync: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Optimized for large data transfers over Direct Connect (faster than Snowball/Storage Gateway). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Automated retries/checksums ensure data integrity. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Batch + ECR: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Runs Docker containers at scale (no EC2 management). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Auto-scales EC2 Spot/Fleet instances for cost efficiency. &nbsp;<br>- Step Functions: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Orchestrates workflows (e.g., pre-processing → analysis → S3 export). &nbsp;<br>- Lambda Trigger: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- S3 events initiate pipelines instantly (no polling). &nbsp;<br> Architecture Flow: &nbsp;<br>1. Sequencers → SAN → DataSync → S3 (raw data). &nbsp;<br>2. S3 Event → Lambda → Step Functions → AWS Batch (processing). &nbsp;<br>3. Batch pulls Docker images from ECR, processes data, writes results to S3. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Snowball Edge): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Not real-time: Snowball adds days of latency (violates "weeks to days" goal). &nbsp;<br>- B (Data Pipeline + EC2 ASG): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 ASG is overkill (AWS Batch handles scaling better for batch jobs). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Data Pipeline is legacy (Step Functions is modern alternative). &nbsp;<br>- D (Storage Gateway + Batch): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Storage Gateway is for hybrid caching, not bulk transfers. &nbsp;<br> Cost Optimization: &nbsp;<br>- Use EC2 Spot Instances in AWS Batch (60-90% cost savings). &nbsp;<br>- DataSync pricing: $0.0125/GB (cheaper than manual transfers). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>C is the only solution that: &nbsp;<br>- Transfers data efficiently (DataSync). &nbsp;<br>- Scales compute dynamically (AWS Batch). &nbsp;<br>- Automates workflows (Step Functions). &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Set up Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send email messages. Store the email template on Amazon SES with parameters for the customer data. Create an AWS Lambda function to call the SendTemplatedEmail API operation and to pass customer data to replace the parameters and the email destination.<br>This solution is the most cost-effective approach that meets all the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Amazon SES is specifically designed as a cloud-based email sending service that replaces traditional SMTP servers with minimal operational overhead.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Configure scale-in protection for the instances during processing<br>This solution addresses the root cause of the problem. Here's why:<br>The issue occurs because the Auto Scaling group is terminating EC2 instances while they're still processing videos. When an instance is terminated during processing:<br>The video processing job is interrupted<br>The SQS message remains invisible for the remainder of the 1-hour visibility timeout<br>When the visibility timeout expires, the message becomes visible again<br>Since maxReceiveCount is set to 1, the message is immediately sent to the dead-letter queue<br>This triggers the CloudWatch alarm, notifying the development team<br>There are no application errors in the logs because the problem isn't with the application code - it's with the infrastructure setup. The videos aren't being processed properly because the instances processing them are being terminated before completion.<br>By configuring scale-in protection for instances during processing, the Auto Scaling group will be prevented from terminating instances that are actively working on video processing jobs. This allows the instances to complete their current work before being terminated during scale-in events.<br>Scale-in protection is the most direct solution because:<br>It addresses the exact problem (premature instance termination)<br>It doesn't require changing the application code<br>It doesn't require modifying the queue configuration<br>It ensures that once an instance starts processing a video, it will be allowed to complete the job<br>This solution maintains the efficiency of the Auto Scaling group while preventing the specific issue that's causing videos to end up in the dead-letter queue.<br>Sources<br>Infinite retries due to exceeded SQS visibility timeout | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUOGzGulGSS1-wtgDIj22USw/infinite-retries-due-to-exceeded-sqs-visibility-timeout）<br>Processing messages in a timely manner in Amazon SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/best-practices-processing-messages-timely-manner.html）<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Update the API endpoint from Regional to private in API Gateway. Create an interface VPC endpoint in the VPC. Create a resource policy, and attach it to the API. Use the VPC endpoint to call the API from the VPC.<br>This solution meets the requirements with the least amount of effort because:<br>Changing the API endpoint type from Regional to private is a straightforward configuration change in API Gateway that restricts access to the API to only be accessible through VPC endpoints.<br>Creating an interface VPC endpoint for API Gateway is a simple process that establishes a private connection between your VPC and API Gateway service without requiring public internet access.<br>Adding a resource policy to the API allows you to define specific access controls, ensuring that the API can only be called from the specified VPC endpoint.<br>This approach maintains the existing authentication mechanisms that are already in place for the APIs, as specified in the requirements.<br>The solution requires minimal changes to the existing architecture and doesn't require modifying the Lambda functions or deploying additional infrastructure.<br>Option D (deploying Lambda functions inside the VPC with an EC2 instance running Apache) would require significantly more effort because:<br>It would require moving Lambda functions into the VPC<br>It would need provisioning and maintaining an EC2 instance<br>It would require installing and configuring Apache server<br>It would introduce an unnecessary proxy layer between the API calls and Lambda functions<br>It would be more complex to manage and maintain over time<br>The private API Gateway endpoint with VPC endpoint approach is a purpose-built solution for this exact requirement, making it the option that requires the least amount of effort while still meeting all the security and access requirements.<br>Sources<br>Prioritize API security - AWS Serverless Multi-Tier Architectures with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/serverless-multi-tier-architectures-api-gateway-lambda/prioritize-api-security.html）<br>Tutorial: Create a private REST API - Amazon API Gateway （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/private-api-tutorial.html）<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. &nbsp;<br> Explanation:<br>The problem is that the FSx for Windows File Server has reached its 10 TB maximum capacity, preventing new Workspaces sessions. The solution must: &nbsp;<br>1. Immediately free up space to restore access. &nbsp;<br>2. Prevent future capacity issues by automating storage scaling. &nbsp;<br>Let’s analyze the options: &nbsp;<br> Option A: Migrate to FSx for Lustre &nbsp;<br>- ❌ FSx for Lustre is not compatible with Windows user profiles (it’s designed for high-performance Linux workloads). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Simply deleting old profiles does not prevent future capacity issues. &nbsp;<br> Option B: Increase Capacity + Automate Scaling &nbsp;<br>- ✅ `update-file-system` allows increasing FSx storage capacity without downtime. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ CloudWatch metric (`FreeStorageCapacity`) monitors free space. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ EventBridge + Lambda can automatically scale storage when thresholds are met. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Immediate fix: Free up space manually (if needed) while automation prevents future issues. &nbsp;<br> Option C: CloudWatch + Step Functions &nbsp;<br>- ❌ While monitoring is correct, Step Functions is overkill for this use case (Lambda is simpler and more cost-effective). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Does not mention immediate remediation (like deleting old profiles first). &nbsp;<br> Option D: Add a Second FSx File System &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Splitting profiles across two file systems adds complexity and does not solve the root issue (storage scaling). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Manual intervention is required to balance users, which is not scalable. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Short-term: Delete old profiles if needed to regain access. &nbsp;<br>- Long-term: Automate scaling using CloudWatch + Lambda to prevent future outages. &nbsp;<br>- FSx for Windows supports scaling up to 64 TB, so this is a sustainable solution. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option C is correct. Using AWS Transfer Family to create an FTP server that places the files directly in Amazon S3 and using S3 event notifications through Amazon SNS to invoke an AWS Lambda function will ensure that the archive always receives the files and that the central system is always updated. This solution maximizes scalability and eliminates the need for manual intervention, such as rebooting the EC2 instance.<br>The correct answer is C. &nbsp;<br> Explanation:<br>The key requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Maximize scalability to handle increasing FTP connections. &nbsp;<br>2. Ensure files are always archived in Amazon S3. &nbsp;<br>3. Update the central system reliably with metadata. &nbsp;<br>4. Cannot modify the handheld devices, so the FTP process must remain unchanged. &nbsp;<br>Let’s analyze the options: &nbsp;<br> Option A: Auto Scaling Group with ALB &nbsp;<br>- ❌ FTP is stateful and does not work well with load balancers (ALB is for HTTP/HTTPS, not FTP). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Rebooting instances (current issue) won’t be fixed—this just spreads the problem across multiple instances. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ No improvement in reliability for file processing or metadata updates. &nbsp;<br> Option B: AWS Transfer Family + EFS &nbsp;<br>- ❌ EFS adds unnecessary complexity—files still need processing by the EC2 instance, which is the bottleneck. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Does not solve the core issue (scalability and reliability of file processing). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ EC2 instance remains a single point of failure for metadata updates. &nbsp;<br> Option C: AWS Transfer Family + S3 + Lambda &nbsp;<br>- ✅ AWS Transfer Family replaces the EC2 FTP server, providing a fully managed, scalable FTP solution. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Files go directly to S3, eliminating the EC2 bottleneck. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ S3 event notifications trigger Lambda, which reliably adds metadata and updates the system (no lost files). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ No changes needed to handheld devices (still use FTP). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Fully serverless and scalable—no EC2 instance to manage or reboot. &nbsp;<br> Option D: Update Handheld Devices to Use S3 Directly &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Violates the requirement (handheld devices cannot be modified). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Not a feasible solution since the question explicitly rules out changes to the devices. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Scalable FTP: AWS Transfer Family handles FTP connections without EC2 limitations. &nbsp;<br>- Reliable processing: S3 + Lambda ensures no files are lost and metadata is always added. &nbsp;<br>- No changes to handheld devices—maintains compatibility. &nbsp;<br>- Fully managed solution—eliminates EC2 maintenance (no more reboots). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Provision an Aurora Replica in a different Region.<br>This solution meets the requirements with the least amount of operational overhead for the following reasons:<br>Zero data loss requirement: Aurora cross-region replicas provide continuous, asynchronous replication with typical lag times of less than a second. This ensures that virtually no data is lost in the event of a primary region failure.<br>Recovery to a separate AWS Region: By provisioning an Aurora Replica in a different region, the company creates a standby database that can be promoted to become the primary database in case of a regional outage or application failure.<br>Least operational overhead: Aurora Replicas are fully managed by AWS, requiring minimal setup and ongoing maintenance. The replication process is handled automatically by the Aurora service.<br>The other options have significant drawbacks:<br>B. AWS DataSync is primarily designed for file-based data transfer between storage systems, not for continuous database replication. It would require additional components and custom scripting to implement a database disaster recovery solution, increasing operational overhead.<br>C. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) can perform continuous replication, but it requires more configuration and monitoring compared to native Aurora replication. It would involve setting up and maintaining replication instances, tasks, and endpoints, resulting in higher operational overhead.<br>D. Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) is designed for managing EBS snapshots and AMIs, not database replication. Using snapshots every 5 minutes would not meet the zero data loss requirement, as any data written between snapshots could be lost. Additionally, restoring from snapshots would result in longer recovery times.<br>Aurora's built-in cross-region replication capability provides the most straightforward and efficient solution for meeting the company's disaster recovery requirements with minimal operational overhead.<br>Sources<br>Comparing Amazon Aurora Replicas, Aurora cross-Region Replicas, and Aurora global databases - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/aurora-replication-options/introduction.html）<br>Disaster recovery options in the cloud - Disaster Recovery of Workloads on AWS: Recovery in the Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html）<br>AWS Backup vs global table/database for cost-effective RTO,RPO requirements | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUWf0GuonKSvW8U2N4o8huHw/aws-backup-vs-global-table-database-for-cost-effective-rto-rpo-requirements）<br><br><br>

Tricky one. This is not an on premise migration use case which prompts for answer C. Its a current situation of on premise application which the <br>company wants to continue its state in the requirement of using AWS as DR solution. <br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/drs/latest/userguide/images/drs-failback-arc.png <br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/drs/latest/userguide/what-is-drs.html<br><br><br>1. Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to replicate the on-premises MySQL database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. This provides a managed database solution with minimal operational overhead.<br>2. Set up AWS Application Discovery Service to analyze the on-premises application and its dependencies. This will help in planning the migration and identifying any potential issues.<br>3. Use AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) to replicate the application servers to Amazon EC2 instances. This service can handle the migration of multiple servers simultaneously and supports incremental replication.<br>4. Configure Amazon Route 53 for DNS failover. This will allow automatic redirection of traffic to the AWS environment in case of a failure in the on-premises infrastructure.<br>5. Implement AWS CloudWatch for monitoring both the on-premises and AWS environments. Set up alarms to notify of any issues or failures.<br>6. Use AWS Systems Manager to manage and configure the EC2 instances, reducing operational overhead for server management.<br>This solution offers several benefits:<br>- Minimal operational overhead: Amazon RDS manages the database, while EC2 instances can be easily managed using Systems Manager.<br>- Automated failover: Route 53 can automatically redirect traffic in case of a failure.<br>- Scalability: The AWS environment can be easily scaled up or down as needed.<br>- Continuous replication: DMS and SMS ensure that the AWS environment stays up-to-date with the on-premises systems.<br>Best practices to consider:<br><br><br>- Regularly test the failover process to ensure business continuity.<br>- Implement proper security measures, such as using security groups and network ACLs to control access to AWS resources.<br>- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage permissions and access to AWS services.<br>- Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and SSL/TLS.<br><br><br>[1] [Amazon RDS for MySQL Resources – AWS] (https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/resources/)<br>[3] [Amazon RDS for MySQL Resources – AWS] (https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/resources/)<br>[6] [Conclusion - Optimizing MySQL Running on Amazon EC2 Using Amazon EBS] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/optimizing-mysql-on-ec2-using-amazon-ebs/conclusion.html)<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. In the company's AWS account, create an IAM role that trusts the auditors' AWS account. Create an IAM policy that has the required permissions. Attach the policy to the role. Assign a unique external ID to the role's trust policy.<br>This solution meets the requirements and follows AWS security best practices for the following reasons:<br>Cross-account IAM roles are the recommended AWS best practice for providing secure access to external entities. This approach allows the auditors to assume a role in the company's account without needing to create and manage separate IAM users.<br>By creating an IAM policy with read-only permissions and attaching it to the role, the company can precisely control what resources and actions the auditors can access, following the principle of least privilege.<br>The trust relationship between the company's role and the auditors' AWS account establishes a secure delegation mechanism that allows users in the auditors' account to assume the role.<br>Including a unique external ID in the role's trust policy adds an additional layer of security by preventing the "confused deputy" problem. The external ID acts as a shared secret between the company and the auditors, ensuring that only authorized entities can assume the role.<br>Option A (creating resource policies for all resources) is not the recommended approach because:<br>It would be extremely time-consuming and error-prone to create and maintain individual resource policies for all resources in the account<br>Not all AWS services support resource-based policies<br>Managing access at the resource level would be much more complex than using a role-based approach<br>It would be difficult to ensure consistent permissions across all resources<br>The IAM role approach provides a centralized, secure, and manageable solution that aligns with AWS security best practices for cross-account access.<br>Sources<br>Access to AWS accounts owned by third parties - AWS Identity and Access Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html）<br>SEC03-BP09 Share resources securely with a third party - AWS Well-Architected Framework (2023-04-10) （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-04-10/framework/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create a three-node DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Configure an application to read data by using DAX and to write data directly to the DynamoDB table.<br>This solution will meet the requirements with the least latency while ensuring high availability for the following reasons:<br>High Availability: A three-node DAX cluster provides better fault tolerance than a two-node cluster. With three nodes distributed across different Availability Zones, the cluster can continue to operate even if one node fails, ensuring the high availability requirement is met for the trading platform.<br>Read Latency: DAX significantly reduces read latency for DynamoDB by caching frequently accessed data. For a trading platform that likely performs many read operations to retrieve market data, prices, and order information, this caching layer can reduce read latency from milliseconds to microseconds.<br>Write Consistency: By writing directly to the DynamoDB table rather than through DAX, the solution ensures that all write operations are immediately consistent. This is crucial for a trading platform where data accuracy is critical (e.g., order placements, trade executions).<br>Overall System Latency: While writing directly to DynamoDB might seem counterintuitive for reducing latency, it actually provides the best balance of low latency and data consistency. DAX is primarily designed as a read-through cache, and its write-through capabilities can introduce additional complexity and potential consistency issues.<br>Option A (two-node DAX cluster with both read and write operations through DAX) has two significant drawbacks:<br>Lower availability: A two-node cluster doesn't provide the same level of fault tolerance as a three-node cluster. If one node fails, you're left with a single node, creating a single point of failure.<br>Potential consistency issues: Writing through DAX can introduce eventual consistency challenges that could be problematic for a latency-sensitive trading platform where accurate, up-to-date data is critical.<br>For a trading platform where both low latency and high availability are essential requirements, a three-node DAX cluster with reads through DAX and writes directly to DynamoDB provides the optimal solution.<br>Sources<br>Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/dynamodbaccelerator/）<br>

<br>The correct answers are B and E. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Optimize costs (current setup is over-provisioned for peak usage). &nbsp;<br>2. Maintain availability (no negative impact during lunchtime traffic spikes). &nbsp;<br>3. Application has bursty traffic (high usage at lunchtime, minimal otherwise). &nbsp;<br> Analysis of Options: &nbsp;<br> Option A: Change to Compute Optimized Instances &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Compute optimized instances are more expensive and unnecessary for a Python backend (not CPU-bound). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Does not address cost optimization—just changes instance type without reducing capacity. &nbsp;<br> Option B: Move Frontend to Amazon S3 (Static Website Hosting) &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Eliminates EC2 costs for the frontend (S3 is cheaper and scales infinitely). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Static websites are highly available (no servers to manage). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Reduces cost without affecting performance (frontend is static content). &nbsp;<br> Option C: Deploy Frontend with Elastic Beanstalk &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Still uses EC2 instances, so no cost savings over current setup. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Overkill for a static website (S3 is simpler and cheaper). &nbsp;<br> Option D: Use Spot Instances for Backend &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Spot Instances can be interrupted, risking availability during lunchtime peaks. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Not ideal for bursty workloads where consistent uptime is critical. &nbsp;<br> Option E: Use Burstable Instances (e.g., T3/T4g) for Backend &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Burstable instances (T-series) are cost-effective for variable workloads. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ CPU credits handle lunchtime spikes, then scale down during low traffic. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Same vCPU count ensures no performance degradation. &nbsp;<br> Why B + E? &nbsp;<br>- Frontend (Option B): Moving to S3 removes unnecessary EC2 costs. &nbsp;<br>- Backend (Option E): Burstable instances optimize costs while handling traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br>Avoid: &nbsp;<br>- Compute optimized (A) → Overkill for Python backend. &nbsp;<br>- Spot Instances (D) → Risk interruptions during peak usage. &nbsp;<br>- Elastic Beanstalk (C) → No cost benefit for static content. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Create an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator with multiple endpoint groups that target endpoints in appropriate AWS Regions. Use the accelerator's static IP address to create a record in public DNS for the apex domain.<br>This solution meets all the requirements with the least effort for the following reasons:<br>Multi-Region deployment support: AWS Global Accelerator is specifically designed to route traffic to multiple AWS Regions, making it ideal for the company's global deployment across two continents.<br>Apex domain compatibility: Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that can be used with an apex domain (also known as a zone apex or naked domain). This is important because apex domains cannot use CNAME records, which would typically be needed for services like Application Load Balancers.<br>Integration with Application Load Balancers: Global Accelerator can use the company's public ALBs as endpoints in different regions, directing users to the closest available endpoint.<br>Consistent user experience: Global Accelerator routes traffic over the AWS global network rather than the public internet, reducing latency and providing a more consistent experience for users across different continents, which complements the DynamoDB global tables approach.<br>Minimal effort: This solution requires minimal configuration - simply creating a Global Accelerator, adding the ALBs as endpoints in appropriate endpoint groups, and then creating a simple A record in the company's existing DNS system pointing to the static IP addresses.<br>Global Accelerator also provides additional benefits that align with the company's needs:<br>Automatic health checking and failover between regions<br>Traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic going to each region<br>Improved availability through anycast static IP addresses<br>Since the company already manages their public DNS internally, they can easily create the necessary A records for the apex domain pointing to Global Accelerator's static IP addresses, completing the solution with minimal effort.<br>Sources<br>Routing strategies for global tables - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/dynamodb-global-tables/routing-strategies.html）<br>REL10-BP02 Select the appropriate locations for your multi-location deployment - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-10-03/framework/rel_fault_isolation_select_location.html）<br>REL10-BP02 Select the appropriate locations for your multi-location deployment - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2024-06-27/framework/rel_fault_isolation_select_location.html）<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Deploy the shared libraries, custom classes, and code for the API's Lambda functions to a Docker image. Upload the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). Configure the API's Lambda functions to use the Docker image as the deployment package.<br>This solution meets the requirements for simplifying deployment and optimizing for code reuse for the following reasons:<br>Code reuse optimization: By packaging all shared libraries, custom classes, and function code into a single Docker image, the company ensures that all components are consistently available to all Lambda functions. This eliminates the need to manage multiple packages or layers separately.<br>Simplified deployment: Using a Docker image stored in Amazon ECR creates a single deployment artifact that contains everything needed for the API's Lambda functions. This simplifies the deployment process as there's only one artifact to build, version, and deploy.<br>Consistency: The Docker image approach ensures that all Lambda functions are using exactly the same versions of shared libraries and custom classes, reducing the risk of compatibility issues.<br>Scalability: As the application grows and more Lambda functions are added, the Docker image approach continues to be efficient since new functions can simply reference the same image without additional configuration.<br>Option A (using Lambda layers with Docker images stored in S3) is incorrect because:<br>Lambda layers don't use Docker images as their source<br>S3 is not the appropriate storage location for Docker images (ECR is the AWS service designed for this purpose)<br>This approach would unnecessarily complicate the deployment process by mixing container and non-container technologies<br>The Docker image approach with ECR provides a cleaner, more consistent solution that better meets the requirements for simplified deployment and code reuse.<br>Sources<br>Deploy .NET Lambda functions with container images - AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/csharp-image.html）<br>Lambda Package Exceeds 60MB: Solutions for Large Dependencies? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUoXSNWrkdSf61jVqG7IwBxg/lambda-package-exceeds-60mb-solutions-for-large-dependencies）<br>Simplifying operations - Implementing Microservices on AWS（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/simplyfing-operations.html） <br><br><br>

<br>The correct answer is B. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The key requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Local defect detection (must work without internet). &nbsp;<br>2. Real-time feedback to factory workers via a local API. &nbsp;<br>3. Deploy ML model on-premises (since cloud connectivity is unreliable). &nbsp;<br> Analysis of Options: &nbsp;<br> Option A: Kinesis + S3 + SageMaker Endpoint + Lambda &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Depends on internet connectivity (SageMaker endpoint is cloud-based). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ No offline capability—fails if the factory loses internet. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Latency issues (uploading images to S3 and waiting for Lambda). &nbsp;<br> Option B: AWS IoT Greengrass on Local Server &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Greengrass runs ML models locally (no internet needed). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Takes still images from cameras and runs inference on-premises. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Calls local API directly for real-time feedback. &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Works offline (syncs with AWS when connectivity is restored). &nbsp;<br> Option C: AWS Snowball &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Snowball is for data transfer, not persistent edge computing. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Overkill—Greengrass is simpler and designed for this use case. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ No real-time processing (Snowball is not a runtime environment). &nbsp;<br> Option D: Amazon Monitron &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Monitron is for vibration/sensor-based monitoring, not image processing. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Cannot deploy custom ML models (only supports Monitron’s predefined ML). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Greengrass is purpose-built for edge ML deployments. &nbsp;<br>- Works offline (critical for factory environments). &nbsp;<br>- Lightweight and scalable (runs on existing Linux server). &nbsp;<br>- Direct integration with local APIs (no cloud dependency). &nbsp;<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The problem is: &nbsp;<br>- Application-layer attacks (e.g., HTTP floods, SQL injection, etc.) causing sudden traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br>- Attacks come from different IPs, making IP-based blocking ineffective. &nbsp;<br>- Goal: Mitigate attacks with minimal operational overhead. &nbsp;<br> Analysis of Options: &nbsp;<br> Option A: CloudWatch Alarm + WAF IP Deny List &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Reactive, not proactive—attacks must already be happening before blocking. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ High operational overhead—manual tuning of thresholds and rules. &nbsp;<br>- ❌ IP-based blocking fails (attackers use many IPs). &nbsp;<br> Option B: AWS Shield Advanced + AWS WAF &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Shield Advanced provides DDoS protection (automatically detects & mitigates attacks). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Works with WAF to block application-layer attacks (e.g., HTTP floods). &nbsp;<br>- ✅ Minimal operational overhead—AWS manages detection and mitigation. &nbsp;<br> Option C: CloudWatch Alarm + Lambda + Route Table Deny Rules &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Subnet route table blocks are too broad (affects all traffic, not just HTTP). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Complex and slow (Lambda + route table updates introduce latency). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Does not scale for large attacks (IP-based blocking is ineffective). &nbsp;<br> Option D: Route 53 Geolocation Blocking &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Geolocation blocking is imprecise (attackers can use proxies/VPNs). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ Manual effort required (log analysis + policy updates). &nbsp;<br>- ❌ False positives (legitimate users from blocked regions are denied). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Shield Advanced automatically mitigates DDoS attacks (network & application layer). &nbsp;<br>- WAF + Shield Advanced together block sophisticated HTTP attacks. &nbsp;<br>- No manual intervention needed—AWS handles detection and mitigation. &nbsp;<br>- Scalable—works even if attackers rotate IPs. &nbsp;<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. On-premises clients must connect to an internal ALB over Direct Connect. &nbsp;<br>2. A firewall appliance will enforce an IP allow list, so the ALB must have static IPs. &nbsp;<br>3. Path-based routing must continue to work (ALB functionality). &nbsp;<br> Problem: &nbsp;<br>- ALBs do not have static IPs (they use dynamic DNS). &nbsp;<br>- NLBs provide static IPs, but NLBs cannot do path-based routing (ALB feature). &nbsp;<br> Solution: &nbsp;<br>- Place an NLB in front of the ALB to provide static IPs for the firewall allow list. &nbsp;<br>- Clients connect to the NLB, which forwards traffic to the ALB (retaining path-based routing). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct? &nbsp;<br>✅ NLB provides static IPs (required for firewall allow list). &nbsp;<br>✅ ALB remains behind NLB, preserving path-based routing. &nbsp;<br>✅ No loss of functionality—ALB still handles TLS termination and routing. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>❌ A: ALBs cannot have static IPs (only NLBs/GWLBs can). &nbsp;<br>❌ C: NLB cannot replace ALB (loses path-based routing). &nbsp;<br>❌ D: GWLB is for third-party appliances, not for this use case. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps (Option B): &nbsp;<br>1. Create an NLB with static IPs in each AZ. &nbsp;<br>2. Point NLB to ALB (ALB becomes a target). &nbsp;<br>3. Add NLB IPs to firewall allow list. &nbsp;<br>4. Update clients to connect to NLB (instead of ALB). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Add a security group rule to the ALB to allow traffic from the AWS managed prefix list for CloudFront only.<br>This solution will meet the requirements with the least operational overhead for the following reasons:<br>Effectiveness: By configuring the ALB's security group to only allow traffic from CloudFront's managed prefix list, you create a network-level restriction that prevents any direct internet access to the ALB. This ensures that all traffic must flow through CloudFront first.<br>Minimal operational overhead:<br>AWS automatically maintains and updates the CloudFront managed prefix list, so you don't need to manually track or update IP ranges when they change<br>This is a one-time configuration that requires minimal ongoing maintenance<br>No additional services or costs are involved<br>Simplicity: This approach uses native AWS networking features (security groups) without requiring additional services or complex configurations.<br>The other options have significant drawbacks:<br>A. Creating a new web ACL with the same rules would add unnecessary complexity and cost. Web ACLs are primarily for filtering malicious traffic patterns, not for restricting access to specific sources.<br>B. Associating the existing web ACL with the ALB wouldn't prevent direct internet access to the ALB; it would only apply the same filtering rules at both the CloudFront and ALB levels.<br>D. Adding security group rules for individual CloudFront IP address ranges would work initially but would create significant operational overhead, as you would need to continuously monitor and update these rules whenever AWS adds or changes CloudFront IP ranges.<br>Using the AWS managed prefix list for CloudFront provides the most efficient and low-maintenance solution to ensure that only traffic coming through CloudFront can reach the ALB.<br>Sources<br>Restrict Application Load Balancer traffic through only CloudFront | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/waf-restrict-alb-allow-cloudfront）<br>WAF on ALB or CloudFront ? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUTY5hPVxgS6Caa3eZHX7-nQ/waf-on-alb-or-cloudfront）<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Enable encryption in transit for ElastiCache for Redis. &nbsp;<br>2. Require authentication (AUTH token) for Redis access. &nbsp;<br>3. Secure storage of credentials (AUTH token). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct? &nbsp;<br>✅ AUTH token enables authentication (required by the audit). &nbsp;<br>✅ Secrets Manager securely stores the token (encrypted, managed rotation). &nbsp;<br>✅ Encryption in transit must be configured (cannot be enabled on an existing cluster—must create a new one or modify the existing one). &nbsp;<br>✅ Application retrieves token securely from Secrets Manager. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>❌ A: While it uses Parameter Store, encryption in transit cannot be enabled on an existing cluster without creating a new one. &nbsp;<br>❌ C & D: SSL certificates are not used for Redis authentication (AUTH tokens are required). &nbsp;<br> Steps to Implement (Option B): &nbsp;<br>1. Create an AUTH token (complex password). &nbsp;<br>2. Store it in Secrets Manager (secure, encrypted). &nbsp;<br>3.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create a new launch template version that uses attribute-based instance type selection. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the new launch template version.<br>This solution will improve the overall reliability of the workload for the following reasons:<br>Root cause identification: The current configuration uses a single instance type in the launch template, which is likely causing the launch failures. When specific instance types are not available in the Spot market, the Auto Scaling group cannot launch new instances, leading to the reported failures and longer wait times.<br>Attribute-based instance type selection: By implementing attribute-based instance type selection in the launch template, the Auto Scaling group can dynamically choose from a variety of instance types that meet the specified attributes (like vCPU, memory, etc.) rather than being restricted to a single instance type. This significantly increases the pool of available Spot Instances.<br>Spot Instance best practices: Using multiple instance types is a recommended best practice for Spot Instance workloads as it increases the chances of finding available capacity in the Spot market, reducing the likelihood of launch failures.<br>Maintaining launch templates: Creating a new version of the existing launch template is more efficient than replacing it entirely, as it preserves other configuration settings while updating only what needs to change.<br>The other options are less effective:<br>A. Replacing the launch template with a launch configuration is not recommended as launch configurations are considered legacy and offer fewer features than launch templates. Additionally, this would require recreating all configuration settings rather than just updating what needs to change.<br>C. Increasing the number of placement groups wouldn't address the fundamental issue of Spot Instance availability. Placement groups control how instances are physically placed relative to each other but don't affect the availability of specific instance types in the Spot market.<br>D. Updating to a larger instance type would still restrict the Auto Scaling group to a single instance type, which doesn't solve the underlying problem of limited Spot Instance availability. It might even worsen the situation if the larger instance type has lower availability in the Spot market.<br>Sources<br>Capacity Rebalancing in Auto Scaling to replace at-risk Spot Instances - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.html）<br>Why is my Auto Scaling group not launching new instances when the load increases? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUQsrSasV_Tyyqw_lB8W9Lfw/why-is-my-auto-scaling-group-not-launching-new-instances-when-the-load-increases）<br>

<br>The correct answer is C. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Immediate deletion of user data across all microservices when the central user service deletes a user. &nbsp;<br>2. Event-driven architecture to ensure all services react in real-time. &nbsp;<br>3. Scalable and decoupled solution (no direct dependencies between microservices). &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>✅ EventBridge provides a centralized event bus for real-time event distribution. &nbsp;<br>✅ Each microservice subscribes to user deletion events via EventBridge rules. &nbsp;<br>✅ Decoupled and scalable—microservices independently process events. &nbsp;<br>✅ Immediate propagation of deletion events (no polling delays). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>❌ A: DynamoDB Streams + SQS + Polling &nbsp;<br>- Polling introduces delays (not immediate). &nbsp;<br>- Complex to manage (each service must poll SQS). &nbsp;<br>❌ B: DynamoDB Notifications + SNS &nbsp;<br>- SNS cannot filter events (all services receive all events, increasing overhead). &nbsp;<br>- Services must implement logic to ignore irrelevant events. &nbsp;<br>❌ D: SQS Queue + Event Filters &nbsp;<br>- SQS does not natively support event filtering (services must process all messages). &nbsp;<br>- Polling is required, leading to latency. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps (Option C): &nbsp;<br>1.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator. Specify the ALB as the accelerator's endpoint. Provide the accelerator's IP addresses to the customer.<br>This solution will meet the requirements with the least operational overhead for the following reasons:<br>Fixed IP addresses: AWS Global Accelerator provides two static anycast IP addresses that remain fixed for the life of the accelerator. This directly addresses the requirement to provide IP addresses to external customers.<br>Preservation of existing architecture: This solution allows the company to keep their current setup with the Application Load Balancer and AWS WAF intact, without requiring any architectural changes.<br>Minimal operational overhead: Global Accelerator is a fully managed service that requires minimal setup and maintenance. Once configured, it automatically routes traffic to the ALB without additional management.<br>Additional benefits: Global Accelerator also provides improved availability and performance by routing traffic through the AWS global network and automatically directing users to the nearest AWS edge location.<br>The other options have significant drawbacks:<br>A. Replacing the ALB with an NLB would require reconfiguring the entire load balancing setup and would lose the AWS WAF integration, as WAF doesn't directly integrate with NLBs. This would create significant operational overhead.<br>B. This option is not technically feasible. You cannot directly assign Elastic IP addresses to Application Load Balancers. ALBs use DNS names, not fixed IP addresses.<br>D. CloudFront distributions don't have fixed IP addresses that can be provided to customers. The IP addresses associated with CloudFront distributions can change over time. Additionally, "pinging" the distribution to determine IP addresses is not a reliable method and goes against AWS best practices.<br>AWS Global Accelerator is specifically designed for use cases where fixed IP addresses are required while maintaining the benefits of AWS networking services like ALB and WAF, making it the optimal solution with the least operational overhead.<br>Sources<br>WAF on ALB or CloudFront ? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUTY5hPVxgS6Caa3eZHX7-nQ/waf-on-alb-or-cloudfront）<br>Integrations for your Application Load Balancer - Elastic Load Balancing （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-integrations.html）<br>Can an Application Load Balancer have a static IP | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU-VlS2bqXTJil3WEwJkfHiA/can-an-application-load-balancer-have-a-static-ip）<br>

<summary>Answer</summary>
<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
The correct answer is A. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) is designed to recover from disasters by providing a cost-effective, fully managed, and scalable solution for disaster recovery. By configuring EC2 instances to use DRS, the company can meet the RPO and RTO objectives for the application tier. Creating a cross-Region read replica for the RDS DB instance ensures that data is replicated to a secondary region, which helps meet the RPO and RTO for the database tier. Having an ALB in a second AWS Region, along with a Global Accelerator endpoint, provides a resilient architecture that can redirect traffic to the healthy region in case of a disaster, thus ensuring optimal latency after failover.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke AWS CodeBuild when the company pushes code to the repository. Use CodeBuild to clone the repository. Create a .zip file of the content. Copy the file to an S3 bucket in the second Region.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Appropriate service selection: AWS CodeCommit repositories are not directly supported by AWS Backup or AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery. The EventBridge and CodeBuild approach is specifically designed to work with code repositories.<br>Automation and triggering: The EventBridge rule will automatically trigger the backup process whenever code is pushed to the repository, ensuring that the backup is always current and reflects the latest changes.<br>Cross-region capability: CodeBuild can be configured to copy the zipped repository content to an S3 bucket in the second region, fulfilling the cross-region backup requirement.<br>Efficiency: This approach is serverless and only runs when needed (when code is pushed), making it cost-effective.<br>Complete backup: The solution captures the entire repository content by cloning it, ensuring a complete backup.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery is designed for EC2 instances and EBS volumes, not for code repositories like CodeCommit. It's not an appropriate service for this use case.<br>B. AWS Backup does not natively support CodeCommit repositories. It's designed for services like EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, and other storage services, but not for code repositories.<br>D. While AWS Step Functions could theoretically orchestrate a backup workflow, CodeCommit doesn't have a native "snapshot" feature that Step Functions could leverage. This approach would still require additional services to actually perform the backup, making it more complex than necessary.<br>The EventBridge and CodeBuild approach (option C) is a well-established pattern for backing up CodeCommit repositories to another region and represents the most appropriate solution for the stated requirements.<br>Sources<br>DR and Fault Tolerance | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUJMujNJwQSpKQIjhmUtEbTQ/dr-and-fault-tolerance）<br>Backup - Ransomware Risk Management on AWS Using the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/ransomware-risk-management-on-aws-using-nist-csf/backup.html）<br>Automate event-driven backups from CodeCommit to Amazon S3 using CodeBuild and CloudWatch Events - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/automate-event-driven-backups-from-codecommit-to-amazon-s3-using-codebuild-and-cloudwatch-events.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer is A. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Shared storage accessible across all pods in an EKS ReplicaSet. &nbsp;<br>2. High performance for many small files. &nbsp;<br>3. Backup retention for 1 year. &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Best? &nbsp;<br>✅ Amazon EFS provides shared, low-latency storage for Kubernetes pods. &nbsp;<br>✅ Multi-AZ availability (mount targets in each subnet). &nbsp;<br>✅ AWS Backup integrates with EFS for automated, long-term retention. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Fail? &nbsp;<br>❌ B: EBS Multi-Attach &nbsp;<br>- Limited to a single Availability Zone (violates multi-AZ resilience). &nbsp;<br>- Not ideal for many small files (better for block storage). &nbsp;<br>❌ C: Amazon S3 &nbsp;<br>- S3 is object storage, not file storage (cannot be directly mounted as a filesystem in EKS without performance tradeoffs). &nbsp;<br>- Higher latency for small file operations. &nbsp;<br>❌ D: Local pod storage &nbsp;<br>- Not shared (files are pod-specific, lost if pod terminates). &nbsp;<br>- No built-in backup solution (third-party tools add complexity). &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps (Option A): &nbsp;<br>1. Create an EFS file system with mount targets in each EKS node subnet. &nbsp;<br>2. Configure the ReplicaSet to mount EFS as a PersistentVolume (PV). &nbsp;<br>3. Set up AWS Backup for EFS with a 1-year retention policy. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Publish events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. Configure the Auto Scaling group to scale in and out based on the ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric of the queue. Configure the application to write failed messages to a dead-letter queue.<br>This solution meets the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Scaling capability: The EC2 Auto Scaling group can be configured to scale in and out based on the ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage metric of the SQS queue. This ensures that as the number of events increases, more EC2 instances are added to process them, and as the queue empties, instances are removed to save costs.<br>Error handling: The solution explicitly states that the application will be configured to write failed messages to a dead-letter queue (DLQ). This satisfies the requirement that if a processing error occurs, the event must move into a separate queue for review.<br>Decoupling: Using SQS as the event queue provides a buffer between event producers and consumers, allowing for reliable event processing even during traffic spikes or when processing instances fail.<br>Control over processing: This approach gives more control over how events are processed, including retry logic, batch processing, and custom error handling.<br>Option A (using SNS with Lambda and an on-failure destination) would also provide scaling and error handling capabilities. However, there are a few reasons why option B might be considered more appropriate for certain scenarios:<br>Long-running processes: If the event processing requires more time than Lambda's maximum execution duration (currently 15 minutes), EC2 instances would be necessary.<br>Custom processing requirements: If the processing requires specific software or libraries that are difficult to package with Lambda, EC2 instances provide more flexibility.<br>Cost considerations: For high-volume, consistent workloads, EC2 instances might be more cost-effective than Lambda functions.<br>Batch processing: EC2 instances can be configured to process multiple messages in a batch, which might be more efficient for certain workloads.<br>Both solutions could work, but option B provides a more traditional and flexible approach to event processing with explicit scaling based on queue metrics and clear error handling through a dead-letter queue.<br>Sources<br>Scaling and event processing with SNS and SQS | AWS re:Post （https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&region=ap-southeast-2&src=header-signin#）<br>Implementing AWS Lambda error handling patterns | AWS Compute Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/compute/implementing-aws-lambda-error-handling-patterns/）<br>

<br>Answer: &nbsp;<br>B. Create an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API that implements the RESTful API. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Create an API Gateway service integration with the SQS queue. Create an AWS Lambda function to process messages in the SQS queue. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Unpredictable Traffic Bursts: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Millions of devices send data with spiky, unpredictable loads. &nbsp;<br>2. Zero Data Loss: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Must durably queue all incoming requests. &nbsp;<br>3. RESTful API Endpoint: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Devices communicate via HTTP(S). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- API Gateway HTTP API: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Low-latency RESTful interface (cheaper/faster than REST API). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Direct SQS Integration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Posts device data directly to SQS (no intermediate compute). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- SQS guarantees no data loss (messages persist until processed). &nbsp;<br>- Lambda for Processing: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Auto-scales with queue depth (handles bursts seamlessly). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Serverless: No EC2 management overhead. &nbsp;<br> Architecture Flow: &nbsp;<br>1. Devices → API Gateway HTTP API → SQS Queue (buffers bursts). &nbsp;<br>2. SQS → Lambda (processes messages, calculates sustainability index). &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (ALB → SQS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- ALB can’t natively integrate with SQS (requires Lambda proxy). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- ECS Fargate is overkill (Lambda is simpler for message processing). &nbsp;<br>- C (API Gateway → EC2): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 scaling lags behind sudden traffic spikes (risk of data loss). &nbsp;<br>- D (CloudFront → Kinesis): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Kinesis is expensive for simple queuing (SQS is cheaper). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- CloudFront doesn’t integrate with Kinesis directly. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. Create SQS Queue: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws sqs create-queue --queue-name device-data<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. Configure API Gateway HTTP API: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Add SQS integration (POST to `https://sqs.region.amazonaws.com/account-id/queue-name`). &nbsp;<br>3.

<br>Based on the requirements for storing large important documents with high durability, availability, encryption at rest and in transit, and customer-managed encryption keys that can be rotated periodically, the answer is:<br>B. Use Amazon S3 with a bucket policy to enforce HTTPS for connections to the bucket and to enforce server-side encryption and AWS KMS for object encryption.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Amazon S3 provides industry-leading durability of 99.999999999% (11 9's), meeting the requirement for high durability. It also offers high availability across multiple Availability Zones.<br>S3 bucket policies can be configured to enforce HTTPS (TLS) for all connections, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.<br>S3 supports server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), allowing the company to manage their own encryption keys.<br>AWS KMS provides key rotation capabilities, allowing the company to periodically rotate their encryption keys while maintaining access to their encrypted data.<br>S3 is a fully managed service, aligning with the company's requirement to use fully managed services as much as possible.<br>S3 is optimized for storing large objects like documents, making it ideal for this use case.<br>Option A (Storage Gateway in file gateway mode) is not the best choice because it's primarily designed for hybrid cloud storage scenarios and adds unnecessary complexity when the goal is to use fully managed services.<br>Option C (DynamoDB with SSL and KMS) is not optimal because DynamoDB is designed for structured data and key-value pairs, not for storing large documents. While it supports encryption features, it's not the most appropriate service for this specific use case.<br>Amazon S3 with the specified security configurations provides the best combination of durability, availability, encryption capabilities, and management simplicity for storing large important documents.<br>Sources<br>Serverless data storage options - AWS Serverless Multi-Tier Architectures with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/serverless-multi-tier-architectures-api-gateway-lambda/serverless-data-storage-options.html）<br>Storage - AWS Well-Architected Framework (2023-04-10) （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-04-10/framework/perf-storage.html）<br>DynamoDB encryption at rest - Amazon DynamoDB （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/EncryptionAtRest.html）<br>Choosing AWS services for data protection - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/backup-recovery/services.html）<br>

<br><br><br> Answer: &nbsp;<br>C. Create a new AWS WAF web ACL. Add a new rule that blocks requests that match the SQL database rule group. Set the web ACL to allow all other traffic that does not match those rules. Attach the web ACL to the ALB in front of the ECS tasks. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Prevent SQL Injection Attacks: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Block malicious SQL queries before they reach ECS tasks. &nbsp;<br>2. Allow Legitimate Traffic: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Ensure valid API requests pass through. &nbsp;<br>3. Operational Efficiency: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Use managed services (minimize custom code/maintenance). &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- AWS WAF SQL Database Rule Group: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Predefined rules to block common SQLi patterns (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No manual tuning required (AWS manages rule updates). &nbsp;<br>- Web ACL Configuration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Block SQLi requests + allow all other traffic (default action). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Attach to ALB (frontend protection). &nbsp;<br>- Zero Impact on Scaling: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Malicious requests are blocked before consuming ECS resources. &nbsp;<br> Implementation Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. Create Web ACL: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws wafv2 create-web-acl \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --name SQLi-Protection \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --scope REGIONAL \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --default-action Allow={} \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>2. Add SQLi Rule: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws wafv2 create-rule-group \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --name SQLi-Rules \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --scope REGIONAL \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --capacity 100 \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --rules '[<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Name": "SQLi-Block",<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Priority": 1,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Statement": { "ManagedRuleGroupStatement": { "VendorName": "AWS", "Name": "AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet" } },<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Action": { "Block": {} },<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "VisibilityConfig": { "SampledRequestsEnabled": true, "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true }<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; ]'<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br>3. Attach to ALB: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; ```bash<br> &nbsp; aws wafv2 associate-web-acl \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --web-acl-arn arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:regional/webacl/SQLi-Protection \<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; --resource-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-alb/1234567890123456<br> &nbsp; ``` &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Monitor Only): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Doesn’t block attacks (only logs them). &nbsp;<br>- B (Bot Control): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Bot Control targets scrapers, not SQLi (different threat). &nbsp;<br>- D (IP Blocking): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Reactive: Requires manual Lambda to update IPs (inefficient). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Easily bypassed (attackers change IPs). &nbsp;<br> Cost Efficiency: &nbsp;<br>- AWS WAF: $5/web ACL/month + $1/rule/month (SQLi rule group is free). &nbsp;<br>- No EC2/Lambda costs (unlike Option D). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>C is the only solution that: &nbsp;<br>- Blocks SQLi proactively (managed rules). &nbsp;<br>- Preserves scaling (no resource waste on attacks). &nbsp;<br>- Requires no maintenance (fully managed). &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the requirements for deploying IoT sensors that connect to AWS IoT Core and store data in DynamoDB across two AWS Regions for business continuity, the answer is:<br>C. Create a domain configuration for AWS IoT Core in each Region. Create an Amazon Route 53 health check that evaluates domain configuration health. Create a failover routing policy with values for the domain name from the AWS IoT Core domain configurations. Update the DynamoDB table to a global table.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Domain configurations for AWS IoT Core allow you to create custom endpoints in each region, which is necessary for multi-region IoT deployments. This gives the sensors a consistent endpoint to connect to while allowing traffic to be routed to different regions.<br>Route 53 health checks can monitor the health of the IoT Core endpoints in each region, enabling automatic failover when issues are detected in the primary region.<br>The failover routing policy with the domain names from the IoT Core domain configurations ensures that IoT devices will connect to the healthy endpoint, maintaining data ingestion capabilities even if one region experiences an outage.<br>DynamoDB global tables provide multi-region replication, ensuring that data is automatically replicated across both regions. This is critical for business continuity as it ensures data availability in both regions without requiring custom replication logic.<br>Option A is incorrect because it mentions migrating data to Amazon Aurora global tables, which is not appropriate for this use case. The requirement specifically mentions storing data in DynamoDB, not Aurora. Additionally, simply creating a Route 53 alias failover policy without proper domain configurations for IoT Core would not provide the necessary infrastructure for multi-region IoT data ingestion.<br>The solution in option C provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring business continuity for both data ingestion (through IoT Core with domain configurations and Route 53 failover) and data storage (through DynamoDB global tables), meeting all the stated requirements.<br>Sources<br>How to implement a disaster recovery solution for IoT platforms on AWS | The Internet of Things on AWS – Official Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/iot/how-to-implement-a-disaster-recovery-solution-for-iot-platforms-on-aws/）<br>Migrating connected device fleets to AWS with Custom Domains for AWS IoT Core | The Internet of Things on AWS – Official Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/iot/migrating-devices-aws-iot-custom-domains/）<br>Community | Building a Multi-region Serverless IoT system （https://community.aws/content/2fjFMxLIwHkcuCy8ui7ya2KRbPt/building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. <br> Why Option B is Correct:<br>1. Fine-Grained Access Control with IAM Policy Conditions: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The finance team's DynamoDB table contains confidential data, and the marketing team should only access specific attributes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - An IAM role in the finance team's account can be configured with a policy that restricts access to only the required DynamoDB attributes using [fine-grained access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/specifying-conditions.html).<br>2. Cross-Account Access via Role Assumption: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The marketing team's account needs to assume the IAM role in the finance team's account. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The finance team's IAM role must have a trust policy allowing the marketing team's account to assume it. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The marketing team's IAM role must have permissions to assume the role in the finance team's account (`sts:AssumeRole`).<br>3. Secure and Scalable Solution: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This approach follows AWS best practices for cross-account access without exposing credentials. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - It ensures least privilege by restricting access to only the required DynamoDB attributes.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- Option A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Service Control Policies (SCPs) are used to set guardrails (permission boundaries) for accounts in AWS Organizations. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- They cannot grant fine-grained DynamoDB attribute access. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- SCPs deny or allow services at a high level but do not manage DynamoDB attribute-level permissions.<br>- Option C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Resource-based policies (attached to DynamoDB) are not supported for DynamoDB (unlike S3 or SQS). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- DynamoDB access must be managed via IAM policies attached to roles/users, not directly on the table.<br>- Option D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Permissions boundaries define the maximum permissions an IAM entity can have but do not enforce fine-grained DynamoDB attribute filtering. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The marketing team would still need an IAM policy with conditions to restrict DynamoDB attribute access.<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the correct solution because it uses fine-grained IAM policies with conditions to restrict DynamoDB access and enables secure cross-account role assumption.<br>

<br><br><br>The correct combination of steps to meet the requirements with the least operational overhead is: &nbsp;<br> B, D, E &nbsp;<br> Detailed Explanation: &nbsp;<br> 1. (B) Configure the IoT devices to publish to AWS IoT Core &nbsp;<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS IoT Core is a fully managed MQTT broker that eliminates the need to manage an on-premises server. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- IoT devices can directly publish telemetry data to AWS IoT Core, reducing infrastructure management. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Supports MQTT, HTTPS, and other protocols natively. &nbsp;<br> 2. (D) Write the metadata to Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) &nbsp;<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed MongoDB-compatible database. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Eliminates the operational burden of managing a self-hosted MongoDB cluster (Option C). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Provides high availability, scalability, and automatic backups. &nbsp;<br> 3. (E) Use AWS Step Functions with AWS Lambda to prepare reports and store them in Amazon S3, then serve via CloudFront &nbsp;<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS Step Functions orchestrates serverless workflows, making it easy to manage periodic jobs (120-600 sec runtime). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS Lambda runs the transformation logic without managing servers. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Amazon S3 + CloudFront provides a scalable, low-cost way to serve reports globally. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Eliminates the need for a constantly running web server (unlike Option F, which requires managing EKS). &nbsp;<br>---<br> Why Other Options Are Not the Best Fit: &nbsp;<br>- A (Lambda to connect to IoT devices): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Lambda is not designed for persistent MQTT connections. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS IoT Core (Option B) is the correct managed solution. &nbsp;<br>- C (Self-managed MongoDB on EC2): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires manual management of backups, scaling, and patching. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Amazon DocumentDB (Option D) is fully managed and a better choice. &nbsp;<br>- F (EKS with EC2 instances): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overly complex for report generation and serving. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Higher operational overhead than serverless (Step Functions + Lambda + S3). &nbsp;<br>---<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ B, D, E (AWS IoT Core + Amazon DocumentDB + Step Functions/Lambda/S3/CloudFront) &nbsp;<br>This combination provides a fully managed, serverless architecture with the least operational overhead.<br><br><br>

<br>The correct answer is C. Here's the detailed explanation:<br> Why Option C is Correct:<br>1. AWS Outposts for Low-Latency & Regulatory Requirements:<br> &nbsp; - Problem: Some applications must stay on-premises due to data residency laws or single-digit millisecond latency needs.<br> &nbsp; - Solution: AWS Outposts brings AWS infrastructure (compute, storage, database, etc.) to the on-premises data center.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Provides consistent AWS experience (same APIs, tools, services as in the cloud).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Ensures low-latency access for local applications.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Helps meet regulatory compliance by keeping data in a specific location.<br>2. AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized for Factory Sites:<br> &nbsp; - Problem: Factory sites have limited network infrastructure but still need to run workloads.<br> &nbsp; - Solution: Snowball Edge Compute Optimized provides AWS compute & storage in a rugged, portable device.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Can run Lambda, EC2, and EBS locally without continuous internet.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Syncs data back to AWS when connectivity is available.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Ideal for remote or disconnected environments.<br>3. Consistent Developer Experience:<br> &nbsp; - Both Outposts and Snowball Edge integrate with AWS services (e.g., EKS, ECS, RDS).<br> &nbsp; - Developers use the same AWS tools (CLI, SDKs, CloudFormation) whether deploying on-premises or in AWS Regions.<br>---<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- A (Migrate to closest AWS Region + Direct Connect):<br> &nbsp;- Fails for applications needing on-premises hosting (due to regulations or latency).<br> &nbsp;- Direct Connect improves connectivity but does not solve data residency or ultra-low latency requirements.<br>- B (Snowball Edge Storage Optimized + Wavelength):<br> &nbsp;- Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is for data transfer/storage, not running persistent workloads.<br> &nbsp;- AWS Wavelength embeds AWS in 5G networks (for mobile apps), not factory sites with limited networking.<br>- D (Local Zone + Wavelength):<br> &nbsp;- AWS Local Zones extend AWS Regions to metro areas but still rely on cloud connectivity (not fully on-premises).<br> &nbsp;- Wavelength is for 5G mobile apps, not factory environments.<br>---<br> Key Takeaways:<br>✅ For on-premises/low-latency needs → AWS Outposts &nbsp;<br>✅ For remote factories → Snowball Edge Compute Optimized &nbsp;<br>✅ Consistent AWS experience across hybrid environments &nbsp;<br>Final Answer: C (AWS Outposts + Snowball Edge Compute Optimized)<br><br><br>

<br>The correct combination of steps to prevent attacks and ensure business continuity in the most cost-effective way is: &nbsp;<br> A & E &nbsp;<br> Detailed Explanation: &nbsp;<br> 1. (A) Use Amazon CloudFront with a Custom Header for Security &nbsp;<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Prevents direct access to the ALB by forcing traffic through CloudFront (reduces DDoS risks). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Custom header validation ensures only CloudFront can forward traffic to the ALB, blocking malicious requests. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Cost-effective: CloudFront provides built-in DDoS protection (AWS Shield Standard) and caching to reduce backend load. &nbsp;<br> 2.

<br>Based on the requirements to migrate a Docker container application that uses NFS version 4 file share to a secure and scalable containerized solution on AWS without provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure, the answer is:<br>A. Deploy the application containers by using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with the Fargate launch type. Use Amazon ElasticFile System (Amazon EFS) for shared storage. Reference the EFS file system ID, container mount point, and EFS authorization IAM role in the ECS task definition.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type provides a fully managed, serverless container orchestration service that eliminates the need to provision or manage the underlying infrastructure, directly meeting the requirement for no infrastructure management.<br>Amazon EFS is a fully managed NFS file system that natively supports NFSv4, making it a direct replacement for the application's existing NFS version 4 file share requirement.<br>EFS integrates seamlessly with ECS Fargate tasks through task definitions, allowing containers to mount the file system and access shared data.<br>The solution is secure as it uses IAM roles for authorization to the EFS file system, implementing the principle of least privilege.<br>Both ECS Fargate and EFS are designed to scale automatically based on demand, meeting the scalability requirement.<br>Option B suggests using Amazon FSx for Lustre instead of EFS. While FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system, it's primarily designed for compute-intensive workloads like high-performance computing, machine learning, and media processing. It would be overprovisioned for a standard application that simply requires NFS v4 compatibility. Additionally, FSx for Lustre is optimized for high throughput and IOPS rather than general-purpose file sharing, making it less suitable for a direct migration of a standard NFS workload.<br>Amazon EFS is purpose-built for general NFS workloads and provides a more straightforward, cost-effective solution for applications that require NFS compatibility without specialized performance requirements.<br>Sources<br>Chat examples - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/best-practices-code-generation/examples-chat.html）<br>Exploring AWS Container Services | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/articles/AR4s12umYqSdGKOpsimKGO7A/exploring-aws-container-services）<br>Run stateful workloads with persistent data storage by using Amazon EFS on Amazon EKS with AWS Fargate - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/run-stateful-workloads-with-persistent-data-storage-by-using-amazon-efs-on-amazon-eks-with-aws-fargate.html）<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. Here’s the detailed explanation:<br> Why Option B is Correct:<br>1. Weighted Target Groups for Controlled Rollout (10% Traffic): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The ALB supports weighted routing between target groups, allowing precise traffic splitting (90% old version, 10% new version). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This meets the requirement that only 10% of customers receive the new logic during testing.<br>2. ALB Stickiness Ensures Consistent User Experience: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Target group stickiness ensures that once a user is routed to a specific version (old or new), they continue to use the same version during the testing window. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This prevents users from switching between versions unpredictably.<br>3. Minimal Operational Overhead: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Uses the existing ALB (no need for a second ALB or Route 53 changes). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No need to modify Auto Scaling groups or launch configurations (unlike Options A, C, and D). &nbsp;<br>---<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- A (Second ALB + Route 53 Weighted Routing): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overly complex—requires managing two ALBs and Route 53 weighted records. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No built-in session stickiness in Route 53 (users might switch versions mid-session). &nbsp;<br>- C (Auto Scaling Rolling Update with MaxBatchSize=10): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Does not guarantee 10% traffic—only controls how many instances update at once. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No session stickiness—users may bounce between old and new versions. &nbsp;<br>- D (Second Auto Scaling Group + LOR Routing): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Least Outstanding Requests (LOR) does not enforce 10% traffic split. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Session stickiness alone isn’t enough—traffic distribution must be explicitly controlled. &nbsp;<br>---<br> Key Takeaways:<br>✅ Weighted target groups in ALB enable precise traffic splitting (90/10). &nbsp;<br>✅ ALB stickiness ensures users stay on the same version during testing. &nbsp;<br>✅ Simpler and more cost-effective than multi-ALB or Route 53 solutions. &nbsp;<br>Final Answer: B (ALB weighted target groups + stickiness)<br>

<br>Based on the requirement to deploy an application that reads and writes objects to S3 across two AWS Regions with the least operational overhead, the answer is:<br>B. Create a new S3 bucket in a second Region. Set up bidirectional S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) between the original S3 bucket and the new S3 bucket. Configure an S3 Multi-Region Access Point that uses both S3 buckets. Deploy a modified application to both Regions.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>S3 Multi-Region Access Points are specifically designed for multi-region access to S3 data, providing a single endpoint that automatically routes requests to the appropriate region based on network conditions and availability.<br>Bidirectional S3 Cross-Region Replication ensures that objects written to either bucket are automatically replicated to the other bucket, maintaining data consistency across regions without requiring application-level replication logic.<br>This solution is purpose-built for S3 multi-region access and requires minimal configuration changes to the application - it simply needs to use the Multi-Region Access Point endpoint instead of a specific bucket endpoint.<br>The entire solution uses native S3 features that are designed to work together, reducing integration complexity and operational overhead.<br>Option A (CloudFront distribution with Global Accelerator) has higher operational overhead because:<br>It requires setting up and managing multiple services (CloudFront and Global Accelerator) that aren't specifically designed for bidirectional S3 access across regions.<br>CloudFront is primarily a content delivery network optimized for read operations, not for write operations that the application requires.<br>Global Accelerator improves network performance but doesn't handle data replication between regions, which would require additional custom logic.<br>This approach would require more complex configuration and ongoing management of multiple services that weren't designed specifically for this use case.<br>The S3 Multi-Region Access Point with bidirectional Cross-Region Replication provides a more streamlined, purpose-built solution with significantly less operational overhead for deploying an application that needs to read and write S3 objects across two regions.<br>Sources<br>Cloudfront OAC S3: Public Reads & Only Signed Secure Writes | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUY3prSJX-QMS-0UtwtmbeMQ/cloudfront-oac-s3-public-reads-only-signed-secure-writes）<br>Replicating objects within and across Regions - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html）<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the requirements for migrating an online gaming platform that needs high performance computing (HPC) and has a frequently changing leaderboard currently using Redis, the answer is:<br>C. Create an Auto Scaling group of c5.large Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances behind an Application Load Balancer. Use an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to maintain the leaderboard.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Compute-optimized instances (c5.large) are specifically designed for compute-intensive workloads like high performance computing (HPC) that the gaming platform requires. The "c" family of instances offers higher CPU performance compared to the general-purpose "m" family, making them better suited for the computational demands of gaming applications.<br>On-Demand Instances provide consistent, uninterrupted performance which is critical for gaming applications where any interruption would negatively impact the user experience. Unlike Spot Instances which can be terminated with little notice, On-Demand Instances ensure stability for the gaming service.<br>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is the ideal choice for maintaining the frequently changing leaderboard as it provides:<br>Sub-millisecond latency for real-time updates<br>In-memory data storage for high-speed access<br>Built-in sorting and ranking capabilities perfect for leaderboards<br>Compatibility with the existing Redis implementation, simplifying migration<br>The Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling group ensures the application can handle varying loads while maintaining high availability.<br>Option A is less suitable because:<br>m5.large instances are general-purpose rather than compute-optimized, making them less efficient for HPC workloads<br>Spot Instances can be interrupted with minimal notice, which would disrupt the gaming experience<br>While Spot Instances are more cost-effective, they sacrifice the reliability and consistent performance needed for a gaming platform<br>The solution in option C provides the optimal combination of compute power, reliability, and performance required for the gaming platform while maintaining compatibility with the existing Redis-based leaderboard system.<br>Sources<br>Migrate Redis workloads to Redis Enterprise Cloud on AWS - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-redis-workloads-to-redis-enterprise-cloud-on-aws.html）<br>Amazon EC2 C6i Instances - Amazon Web Services （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/ec2/instance-types/c6i/）<br>Best practices for Amazon EC2 Spot - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html）<br>About the migration strategies - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/large-migration-guide/migration-strategies.html）<br>

<br>The correct answers are A and D. <br> Why Option A is Correct:<br>1. Direct Connect Gateway for Multi-Region VPC Access:<br> &nbsp; - Creates a hub that connects your Direct Connect connection to multiple VPCs across different regions<br> &nbsp; - Allows the single existing Direct Connect connection to access all three VPCs<br> &nbsp; - Most cost-effective solution as it doesn't require additional Direct Connect connections<br>2. Simplified Architecture:<br> &nbsp; - Single connection management point<br> &nbsp; - No need for additional physical connections<br> Why Option D is Correct (Not C or E):<br>1. Access to AWS Public Services:<br> &nbsp; - A public VIF is specifically designed to access AWS public services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)<br> &nbsp; - Required to meet the "access to AWS public services" requirement in the question<br> &nbsp; - More efficient than routing public service traffic through VPN (Option C)<br>2. Complete Solution:<br> &nbsp; - Option A handles private VPC access across regions<br> &nbsp; - Option D handles public AWS services access<br> &nbsp; - Together they satisfy all requirements<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- B: Additional Direct Connect connections are expensive and unnecessary<br>- C: Private VIF + VPN is redundant when you already have Direct Connect and doesn't efficiently handle public services<br>- E: VPC peering doesn't help with public services access and complicates the architecture<br> Key Advantages of A+D Solution:<br>1.

Based on the scenario described, here are the three items the solutions architect should check to ensure identity federation is properly configured:<br><br><br>1. The IAM roles created for the federated users' or federated groups' trust policy have set the SAML provider as the principal.<br>   This is crucial for allowing the SAML-authenticated users to assume the appropriate IAM roles. The trust policy should specify the SAML provider as the principal who can assume the role.<br><br><br>2. Test users are not in the AWSFederatedUsers group in the company's IdP.<br>   If the test users are not part of the correct group in the identity provider, they may not receive the necessary SAML assertions to access AWS resources. Ensure that the test users are added to the appropriate group in the company's IdP.<br><br><br>3. The on-premises IdP's DNS hostname is reachable from the AWS environment VPCs.<br>   For the federation to work correctly, there needs to be proper network connectivity between the on-premises IdP and the AWS environment. Ensuring that the IdP's DNS hostname is reachable from the AWS VPCs is important for the SAML authentication process.<br><br><br>It's important to note that the option suggesting "The IAM user's permissions policy has allowed the use of SAML federation for that user" is not correct in this context. SAML federation doesn't rely on IAM user permissions, but rather on the trust relationship between the SAML provider and the IAM roles.<br><br><br>To further improve the federation setup and troubleshoot any issues, the solutions architect should also consider the following best practices:<br><br><br>- Review the SAML metadata document from the IdP to ensure it's correctly configured and uploaded to AWS.<br>- Check that the SAML assertions from the IdP contain the correct attributes and values expected by AWS.<br>- Verify that the IAM roles have the appropriate permissions policies attached to grant the necessary access to AWS resources.<br>- Use AWS CloudTrail logs to investigate any authentication or authorization failures.<br>- Test the SAML configuration using the AWS CLI or SDK to isolate any issues specific to console access.<br><br><br>Remember to always follow the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM roles and policies, and regularly review and audit the federation setup to maintain security best practices.<br>Sources<br>[1] [SCIM profile and SAML 2.0 implementation - AWS IAM Identity Center] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/scim-profile-saml.html)<br>[3] [SAML 2.0 federation - AWS Identity and Access Management] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html)<br>[6] [Create a SAML identity provider in IAM - AWS Identity and Access Management] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml.html)<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the requirements to handle connection load for an Aurora MySQL database experiencing overloaded connections, while securely storing credentials with automatic rotation capability, the answer is:<br>A. Deploy an Amazon RDS Proxy layer. In front of the DB instance. Store the connection credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>RDS Proxy specifically addresses the connection overload issue by providing connection pooling. It efficiently manages database connections, allowing the application to handle more traffic without overwhelming the database with too many connections.<br>Since most of the application's operations are inserts, RDS Proxy is particularly beneficial as it maintains persistent connections to the database, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each insert operation.<br>AWS Secrets Manager provides secure storage for database credentials, eliminating the security risk of storing them in a text-based configuration file.<br>Secrets Manager offers built-in functionality for automatic credential rotation on a regular basis, which directly fulfills the requirement for automatic credential rotation.<br>RDS Proxy integrates natively with Secrets Manager, creating a comprehensive solution that addresses both the connection management and credential security requirements.<br>Option C (Create an Aurora Replica and store credentials in Secrets Manager) would not effectively address the connection overload issue for an insert-heavy workload, as write operations would still go to the primary instance. While it would solve the credential security and rotation requirements, it wouldn't resolve the primary problem of overloaded connections.<br>Sources<br>Amazon RDS Proxy - Oracle to Aurora MySQL Migration Playbook （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/oracle-to-aurora-mysql-migration-playbook/chap-oracle-aurora-mysql.tools.rdsproxy.html）<br>Amazon RDS Proxy overview - SQL Server to Aurora MySQL Migration Playbook （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sql-server-to-aurora-mysql-migration-playbook/chap-sql-server-aurora-mysql.tools.rdsproxy.html）<br>Automate Amazon RDS credential rotation with AWS Secrets Manager for primary instances with read replicas | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/automate-amazon-rds-credential-rotation-with-aws-secrets-manager-for-primary-instances-with-read-replicas/）<br>Read replica of RDS with Secrets Manager integration | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUdLdC7_nNRWm93ScLB2WO5Q/read-replica-of-rds-with-secrets-manager-integration）<br>Amazon RDS Proxy for Aurora - Amazon Aurora （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy.html）<br>Amazon RDS Proxy - Oracle to Aurora PostgreSQL Migration Playbook （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/oracle-to-aurora-postgresql-migration-playbook/chap-oracle-aurora-pg.tools.rdsproxy.html）<br>AWS managed RDS password rotation | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUZiq-Gwb3R46N9TDG-zTWRw/aws-managed-rds-password-rotation）<br>

<br>The most cost-effective solution that meets the RPO of 30 seconds and RTO of 10 minutes is:<br> Correct Answer: B &nbsp;<br> Why Option B? &nbsp;<br>1. Cross-Region Read Replica for RDS MySQL &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Ensures low RPO (30 seconds) by continuously replicating data to the DR Region. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Promotes the replica to primary in case of disaster. &nbsp;<br>2. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) for EC2 Instances &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Continuously replicates EC2 instances to the DR Region, meeting the RPO requirement. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Allows minimal capacity in the DR Region (cost-effective) before scaling up during failover. &nbsp;<br>3. Auto Scaling Group in DR Region &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Running at minimum capacity reduces costs while allowing quick scaling (meeting RTO of 10 minutes). &nbsp;<br>4. Route 53 Failover Routing Policy &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Automatically redirects traffic to the DR Region when the primary fails. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Backing up EC2 every 30 seconds is impractical (AWS Backup doesn’t support such frequent backups). Restoring from backup is slow (high RTO). &nbsp;<br>- C: Manual restores violate RTO, and 30-second backups are unrealistic. &nbsp;<br>- D: Aurora Global Database is overkill (original DB is MySQL, not Aurora).

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Option C is the correct answer because it utilizes AWS Backup, which is a fully managed service that can back up the Amazon EBS volumes and the EC2 instance configurations. By scheduling daily backups and copying them to a vault in a secondary region, the company can ensure that backups are maintained offsite and are available for a rapid recovery. The use of AWS Backup also provides a centralized management console for monitoring and reporting on backup activities, which aligns with the company's need for a solution that optimizes operational efficiency and cost. In the event of a failure, the company can use the CloudFormation template to recreate the network environment and restore the instance volumes and configurations from the backup vault within one business day, adhering to the company's recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).<br> Key Requirements:<br>1. Cross-Region Backups: Must maintain backups in a separate AWS Region.<br>2. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Recover within 1 business day.<br>3. Recovery Point Objective (RPO): No more than 1 day's worth of data loss.<br>4. Operational Efficiency: Limited staff, so automation is crucial.<br>5. Cost Optimization: Need a cost-effective solution.<br>6. Existing CloudFormation Template: Already available for network configuration in the secondary Region.<br> Why Option C is Best?<br>- AWS Backup is a fully managed service that automates backup scheduling, retention, and cross-region copying.<br>- It supports EC2 instances and EBS volumes, ensuring consistent backups.<br>- Cross-Region Copy can be configured to replicate backups to the secondary Region.<br>- Restoration is simple: In case of failure, the CloudFormation template can deploy the network, and AWS Backup can restore the instances and EBS volumes.<br>- Minimal operational overhead: AWS Backup handles lifecycle management, reducing manual work.<br> Why Other Options Are Less Suitable?<br>- A: While possible, managing snapshots via Systems Manager Automation runbooks is more complex than using AWS Backup.<br>- B: Amazon DLM only manages EBS snapshots, not full instance recovery (including configurations). It doesn’t handle cross-region copying as seamlessly as AWS Backup.<br>- D: AWS DataSync is for active data replication, not backups. Running duplicate instances is costly, and this approach doesn’t guarantee point-in-time recovery.<br> Conclusion<br>AWS Backup (Option C) is the most automated, cost-effective, and compliant solution for meeting the RTO, RPO, and cross-region backup requirements.<br><br><br>

<br>The correct combination of steps to meet the encryption requirements (encrypted in transit and at rest) are:<br>A. Turn on S3 server-side encryption for the S3 bucket that the web application uses. &nbsp;<br>→ Ensures data is encrypted at rest in Amazon S3. &nbsp;<br>C. Create a bucket policy that denies any unencrypted operations in the S3 bucket that the web application uses. &nbsp;<br>→ Enforces encryption in transit by denying unencrypted (HTTP) requests to S3. &nbsp;<br>E. Configure redirection of HTTP requests to HTTPS requests in CloudFront. &nbsp;<br>→ Ensures all traffic between users and CloudFront is encrypted in transit by forcing HTTPS. &nbsp;<br> Why not the others? &nbsp;<br>- B: S3 ACLs (Access Control Lists) do not support the `aws:SecureTransport` condition; this must be set in a bucket policy, not ACLs. &nbsp;<br>- D: CloudFront does not store data persistently, so "encryption at rest" does not apply (it's for data in transit). &nbsp;<br>- F: Presigned URLs can enforce HTTPS, but this is not a primary solution for general encryption in transit (bucket policy and CloudFront HTTPS redirection are better). &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>A. Enabling S3 server-side encryption ensures that the data stored in the S3 bucket is encrypted at rest.<br>C. A bucket policy that denies unencrypted operations ensures that any attempt to access the bucket without using HTTPS will be rejected, thus enforcing the use of encryption in transit for all operations with the bucket.<br>E. Configuring CloudFront to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS requests ensures that all user interactions with the website are encrypted in transit.<br>While options D and F might seem relevant, they are not necessary for this scenario. Option D is about encrypting data at rest on CloudFront, which is redundant if the data is already encrypted at rest on S3. Option F, the RequireSSL option for pre-signed URLs, is an additional security measure but not a requirement for the given scenario since the question focuses on general data encryption at rest and in transit.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer. AWS Secrets Manager is designed to securely manage and rotate secrets, such as database credentials. By storing the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and encrypting them with a customer managed key in AWS KMS, the solution architect can ensure that the production database credentials are encrypted and only accessible to the IT security team. Additionally, Secrets Manager can rotate the credentials on a regular basis, meeting the requirement for key rotation. Attaching a role to each Lambda function allows the functions to access the secrets as needed, and restricting access to the secret and the KMS key ensures that only authorized individuals can manage the credentials.Here's why:<br> Requirements Recap:<br>1. Secure Storage of Production DB Credentials: The credentials must be encrypted, and only the IT security team should have access to the encryption key.<br>2. Key Rotation: The encryption key must be rotated regularly.<br>3. Lambda Access: Lambda functions need access to the credentials securely.<br>4. Restricted Access: Only the IT security team should manage the key and credentials.<br> Why Option D is Correct?<br>- AWS Secrets Manager is designed for securely storing and managing secrets (like database credentials).<br> &nbsp;- It integrates with AWS KMS for encryption using a customer-managed key (allowing key rotation).<br> &nbsp;- You can restrict access to the secret and the KMS key via IAM policies, ensuring only the IT security team can manage them.<br> &nbsp;- Lambda functions can retrieve the credentials securely by assuming an IAM role with permissions to access the secret.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect?<br>- Option A: While Systems Manager Parameter Store (SecureString) can store encrypted values, Secrets Manager is better suited for database credentials because it offers automatic rotation, tighter integration with RDS, and better access control.<br>- Option B: Storing credentials in environment variables (even if encrypted) is less secure than using Secrets Manager. Environment variables can be exposed in logs or via AWS APIs.<br>- Option C: Similar to B, storing credentials in environment variables is not best practice for sensitive data like production DB credentials.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option D is the most secure and AWS-recommended approach for managing database credentials in a serverless architecture while meeting the given requirements.<br>

<br>Based on the requirements to migrate a legacy .NET application to AWS using managed services where possible, without rewriting the application, while resolving scaling issues and minimizing licensing costs, the answer is:<br>A. Deploy Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer for the web tier and for the application tier. Use Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with Babelfish turned on to replatform the SQL Server database.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>It maintains the existing application architecture (web tier, application tier, database) without requiring a rewrite of the application code, which is a key requirement.<br>Using EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups addresses the scaling issues by automatically adjusting capacity based on demand for both the web and application tiers.<br>Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with Babelfish provides SQL Server compatibility while significantly reducing licensing costs. Babelfish allows Aurora PostgreSQL to understand T-SQL and TDS protocol, enabling SQL Server applications to work with Aurora PostgreSQL with minimal code changes.<br>This approach leverages AWS managed services (Auto Scaling, ALB, Aurora) while maintaining compatibility with the existing .NET application.<br>Option D (using Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and Athena) would require completely redesigning and rewriting the application into a serverless architecture, which violates the requirement of not rewriting the application. While serverless could potentially be cost-effective, the extensive redevelopment effort would be significant and unnecessary given the constraints.<br>The solution in option A provides the best balance of using AWS managed services, addressing scaling issues, minimizing licensing costs, and avoiding application rewrites.<br>Sources<br>Migrating SQL Server - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-microsoft-workloads-aws/migrating-sql-server-workloads.html）<br>How to optimize costs for Microsoft workloads on AWS | Microsoft Workloads on AWS （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/modernizing-with-aws/how-to-optimize-costs-for-microsoft-workloads-on-aws/）<br>Paths to the cloud - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-microsoft-workloads-aws/cloud-paths.html）<br>Make SQL Server end of support the start of your AWS cloud journey | Microsoft Workloads on AWS（https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/modernizing-with-aws/make-sql-server-end-of-support-the-start-of-your-aws-cloud-journey/） <br>

<br>Based on the requirements to improve API response times for users outside the United States while minimizing operational overhead, the answer is:<br>C. Add an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Configure the ALB as the origin.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>AWS Global Accelerator is specifically designed to improve the availability and performance of applications for global users by routing traffic through AWS's global network infrastructure rather than the public internet.<br>Global Accelerator works seamlessly with ALBs and supports all TCP traffic, including non-standard HTTP methods like LINK, UNLINK, LOCK, and UNLOCK mentioned in the question.<br>Implementation requires minimal changes to the existing architecture - you simply create an accelerator and add the ALB as an endpoint, which aligns with the requirement for minimal operational overhead.<br>Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that serve as fixed entry points to your application, making it easier for global users to connect with lower latency.<br>Let's compare with the other options:<br>Option A (CloudFront): While CloudFront can improve global performance, it's primarily designed for content delivery and caching. It may require additional configuration for non-standard HTTP methods and might not be optimal for dynamic API requests.<br>Option B (API Gateway): Would require significant architectural changes to your existing setup and potentially introduce new complexities, increasing operational overhead.<br>Option D (Multi-region deployment): While effective for performance, this approach requires deploying and maintaining the EKS cluster in multiple regions, which significantly increases operational overhead and costs.<br>AWS Global Accelerator provides the best balance of performance improvement for global users and minimal operational overhead for your specific use case with non-standard REST methods.<br>Sources<br>PERF05-BP02 Evaluate available networking features - AWS Well-Architected Framework (2023-04-10)（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-04-10/framework/perf_select_network_evaluate_features.html） <br>Get suggestions to optimize application performance in Internet Monitor (Optimize page) - Amazon CloudWatch （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-insights.html）<br>PERF05-BP02 Evaluate available networking features - AWS Well-Architected Framework (2022-03-31) （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2022-03-31/framework/perf_select_network_evaluate_features.html）<br>Amazon API Gateway - Serverless Applications Lens （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/amazon-api-gateway.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer. By writing data to an Amazon SQS queue, the Lambda function can offload the workload from the on-premises SQL database. The queue acts as a buffer that smooths out the invocation rate, preventing the database from being overwhelmed by too many concurrent connections. Configuring the Lambda function to process messages from the queue at a controlled rate ensures that the number of connections to the database does not exceed its capacity. Setting a reserved concurrency limit on the Lambda function helps to further control the rate of execution and protect the database from being overloaded.<br>The issue is that the on-premises SQL database crashes due to too many concurrent connections from the Lambda function. To solve this, we need to: &nbsp;<br>1. Throttle the Lambda function's concurrency to match the database's connection limit. &nbsp;<br>2. Use an SQS queue as a buffer to handle spikes in requests without overwhelming the database. &nbsp;<br>Option A is correct because: &nbsp;<br>- SQS decouples the Lambda function from the database, allowing writes to be processed at a controlled rate. &nbsp;<br>- Reserved concurrency ensures Lambda doesn’t exceed the database’s connection limit. &nbsp;<br>- Direct Connect is still used (no need to migrate data or change the database). &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Aurora Serverless + DataSync): Migrating to Aurora is unnecessary and doesn’t solve the concurrency issue directly. &nbsp;<br>- C (RDS Proxy): RDS Proxy manages database connections, but it only works with AWS RDS databases, not on-premises SQL databases. &nbsp;<br>- D (SNS + Provisioned Concurrency): SNS doesn’t buffer requests like SQS, and provisioned concurrency doesn’t limit concurrent executions (it only pre-initializes instances). &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ A. Write the data to an Amazon SQS queue, configure the Lambda function to read from the queue, and set a reserved concurrency limit.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. By creating a new VPC dedicated to outbound internet traffic and connecting it to the existing transit gateway, the company can centralize the management of outbound traffic. Configuring a new NAT gateway within this VPC ensures that traffic to the internet is properly routed and translated. The use of AWS Network Firewall allows for rule-based filtering, and by creating endpoints in each Availability Zone, the solution provides a scalable and highly available architecture. Modifying the default routes to point to the Network Firewall endpoints ensures that all outbound traffic from the VPCs is subject to the filtering policies, meeting the company's security requirements with minimal operational overhead.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Centrally managed rule-based filtering for outbound internet traffic across 100+ AWS accounts. &nbsp;<br>2. Peak traffic ≤ 25 Gbps per Availability Zone (AWS Network Firewall supports up to 30 Gbps per endpoint). &nbsp;<br>3. Single AWS Region deployment with a centralized Transit Gateway for inter-account routing. &nbsp;<br>4. No open-source proxy maintenance (AWS Network Firewall is a managed service). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct? &nbsp;<br>✅ Centralized Security VPC: A dedicated VPC with AWS Network Firewall provides rule-based filtering for all outbound traffic. &nbsp;<br>✅ Transit Gateway Integration: The existing Transit Gateway connects all accounts to the centralized firewall. &nbsp;<br>✅ Scalability: Network Firewall endpoints in each AZ handle up to 30 Gbps, meeting the 25 Gbps requirement. &nbsp;<br>✅ No Proxy Maintenance: Unlike open-source proxies (Option A & D), AWS Network Firewall is fully managed. &nbsp;<br>✅ Route Modification: Default routes in all VPCs point to the Network Firewall endpoints, enforcing filtering. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Wrong? &nbsp;<br>❌ A: Open-source proxy on EC2 requires management overhead and lacks AWS’s scalability. &nbsp;<br>❌ C: Deploying Network Firewall per account is not centralized and increases management complexity. &nbsp;<br>❌ D: Open-source proxies on EC2 lack centralized control and require manual scaling. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the most scalable, manageable, and AWS-native solution for centralized outbound traffic filtering. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer. This solution ensures high availability by using a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group, which allows the application to remain available even if one Availability Zone goes down. The Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic to the EC2 instances. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is used to filter the inbound requests for common vulnerability attacks, and a web ACL (Web Access Control List) is created to define the rules for these filters. The use of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose allows the rejected requests to be sent to the third-party auditing application. Additionally, enabling logging with the Kinesis Data Firehose as the destination ensures that logs are sent to the auditing application. Subscribing to AWS Managed Rules in AWS Marketplace provides additional security measures by leveraging predefined security rules.<br>1. Inbound requests filtered for common vulnerability attacks: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS WAF with a web ACL and AWS Managed Rules (from AWS Marketplace) helps filter and block common web exploits like SQL injection, XSS, etc.<br>2. Rejected requests sent to a third-party auditing application: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Enabling WAF logging and configuring Kinesis Data Firehose to deliver logs to the third-party auditing application fulfills this requirement.<br>3. High availability: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - A Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group ensures that EC2 instances are distributed across multiple Availability Zones, providing fault tolerance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The ALB also inherently supports high availability by distributing traffic across healthy instances.<br> Why not the other options?<br>- A: Uses Amazon Inspector, which is for vulnerability assessment of EC2 instances, not real-time traffic filtering. Also, Lambda pushing reports is less efficient than direct logging via Kinesis Firehose.<br>- B: Lacks Multi-AZ Auto Scaling, risking availability. Also, CloudWatch Logs + Lambda is less direct than Kinesis Firehose for log delivery.<br>- C: Misses Multi-AZ Auto Scaling, compromising high availability.<br> Correct Answer: D ✅ &nbsp;<br>This solution covers WAF filtering, log delivery via Kinesis Firehose, and high availability with Multi-AZ Auto Scaling.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. By creating an interface VPC endpoint for API Gateway, the architect can establish a private connection between the VPC and the API Gateway, ensuring that the API is not accessible from the public internet. Setting an endpoint policy to only allow access to the specific API and adding a resource policy to API Gateway to only allow access from the VPC endpoint further enhances security. Changing the API Gateway endpoint type to private ensures that the API is not exposed to the public internet, thus protecting proprietary data from traversing the public internet.<br>1. The API should not be accessible from the public internet.<br>2. Proprietary data should not traverse the public internet.<br>3. Only the older microservices (EC2 instances) should be able to call the new API.<br> Solution Breakdown (Option B):<br>1. Create an interface VPC endpoint for API Gateway &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This allows private connectivity between the VPC (where EC2 instances are running) and API Gateway without going over the public internet.<br> &nbsp; - The endpoint policy restricts access to only the specific API.<br>2. Set an API Gateway resource policy to allow access only from the VPC endpoint &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Ensures that only requests originating from the VPC (via the endpoint) can access the API.<br>3. Change the API Gateway endpoint type to private &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This makes the API accessible only via the VPC endpoint, blocking public internet access entirely.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A: A VPN is unnecessary since API Gateway supports private VPC endpoints. Also, API keys alone don't enforce private network access.<br>- C: IAM authentication is good for access control, but it doesn't prevent traffic from going over the internet unless combined with a private endpoint (which is already covered in Option B).<br>- D: Global Accelerator improves performance but still uses public IPs, so data traverses the internet, violating the requirement.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option B is the most secure and efficient solution, ensuring private connectivity between the EC2 instances and API Gateway without exposing the API to the internet.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the fastest way to meet the requirements. AWS Config is designed to track and evaluate the configurations of AWS resources, including EC2 security groups. By enabling AWS Config, the architect can quickly set up monitoring and alerting for configuration changes. Any noncompliant changes to the EC2 security groups can be sent as alerts through an Amazon SNS topic, allowing for immediate notification when changes occur. This approach provides a direct and efficient method for tracking changes and ensuring compliance, without the need for additional infrastructure or more complex setups.<br>- AWS Config is specifically designed to track configuration changes and assess compliance against predefined rules. It can detect noncompliant changes to EC2 security groups and trigger alerts via Amazon SNS.<br>- AWS CloudTrail (Option B) logs API calls but does not directly assess compliance or provide alerts without additional CloudWatch rules and custom logic.<br>- SCPs (Options A & C) are used in AWS Organizations to restrict permissions but do not track changes or send alerts.<br>- Option D provides a direct, automated solution for tracking and alerting on noncompliant security group changes without requiring complex setups.<br>Thus, Option D is the most efficient and fastest solution. <br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">ACE</span>
<br>Based on the scenario where IoT sensors are streaming data to Kinesis Data Streams and multiple applications are experiencing ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded errors, the correct actions to resolve this issue are:<br>A. Reshard the stream to increase the number of shards in the stream. <br>C. Use consumers with the enhanced fan-out feature. <br>E. Use an error retry and exponential backoff mechanism in the consumer logic.<br>Here's why these are the correct choices:<br>A. Reshard the stream to increase the number of shards in the stream:<br>Each Kinesis shard provides a limited read throughput (2 MB/sec shared among all standard consumers).<br>When multiple applications are reading from the same stream, they're competing for this limited throughput.<br>Increasing the number of shards distributes the data and read operations across more shards, providing more total throughput capacity for the stream.<br>This directly addresses the ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded error by providing more resources.<br>C. Use consumers with the enhanced fan-out feature:<br>Enhanced fan-out allows each consumer to get dedicated throughput of up to 2 MB/sec per shard.<br>This eliminates contention between consumers since each gets its own dedicated throughput.<br>Enhanced fan-out is specifically designed for scenarios with multiple consumers reading from the same stream.<br>This feature significantly reduces the likelihood of throughput-related errors.<br>E. Use an error retry and exponential backoff mechanism in the consumer logic:<br>Even with proper provisioning, occasional throttling can still occur.<br>Implementing retry logic with exponential backoff is a best practice for handling transient errors.<br>This approach allows the application to gracefully handle temporary throughput issues.<br>The exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the system with immediate retries.<br>The other options are incorrect because:<br>B (Using KPL and adjusting polling frequency): The Kinesis Producer Library is for producers, not consumers, so it wouldn't help with read throughput issues.<br>D (Reducing the number of shards): This would decrease available throughput and make the problem worse.<br>F (Dynamic partitioning): This is a feature of Kinesis Data Firehose, not Kinesis Data Streams, and wouldn't address the read throughput issue.<br>Sources<br>Troubleshoot Kinesis Data Streams consumers - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/troubleshooting-consumers.html）<br>GetRecords - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_GetRecords.html）<br>Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to deliver real-time data to Amazon OpenSearch Service domains with Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion | AWS Big Data Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/use-amazon-kinesis-data-streams-to-deliver-real-time-data-to-amazon-opensearch-service-domains-with-amazon-opensearch-ingestion/）<br>Handle startup, shutdown, and throttling - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-additional-considerations.html）<br>

<br>Based on the requirement to get a list of underutilized EC2 instances across an organization with recommendations for downsizing with the least effort, the answer is:<br>B. Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on all the EC2 instances by using AWS Systems Manager. Retrieve the resource optimization recommendations from AWS Cost Explorer in the organization's management account. Use the recommendations to downsize underutilized instances in all accounts of the organization.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Installing the CloudWatch agent using AWS Systems Manager allows for efficient collection of detailed memory and CPU metrics across all EC2 instances in the organization. Systems Manager provides a centralized way to deploy and configure the agent across multiple accounts.<br>AWS Cost Explorer in the organization's management account provides consolidated resource optimization recommendations for all member accounts in the AWS Organizations structure. This centralized approach allows you to view and analyze recommendations for all accounts from a single location.<br>Accessing the recommendations from the management account requires significantly less effort than accessing each individual account separately, as you only need to log in once and can see all recommendations in one place.<br>Option C suggests retrieving recommendations from each individual account in the organization, which would require logging into each account separately and manually consolidating the data. This approach would require much more effort, especially for organizations with many accounts.<br>The centralized approach in option B provides a comprehensive view of all underutilized instances across the organization from a single access point, making it the solution that requires the least effort to meet the company's requirements.<br>Sources<br>AWS Cost Optimization Hub and AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-coh.html）<br>Optimize Your AWS Spend with New Cost Savings Features in AWS Trusted Advisor | AWS Cloud Financial Management （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/optimize-your-aws-spend-with-new-cost-savings-features-in-aws-trusted-advisor/）<br>AWS Cost Optimization | AWS Cloud Financial Management （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/aws-cost-management/cost-optimization-hub/）<br>Best practices to optimize costs after mergers and acquisitions with AWS Organizations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog（https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/best-practices-to-optimize-costs-after-mergers-and-acquisitions-with-aws-organizations/） <br>Compute Optimizer Dashboard - Guidance for Advanced Cloud Observability with Cloud Intelligence Dashboards on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guidance/latest/advanced-cloud-observability-with-cloud-intelligence-dashboard/compute-optimizer-dashboard.html）<br>Optimizing your cost with rightsizing recommendations - AWS Cost Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-rightsizing.html）<br>Cost optimization recommendations (from Cost Optimization Hub) - AWS Data Exports（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/table-dictionary-cor.html） <br>Cost Optimization Hub and AWS Organizations trusted access - AWS Cost Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/coh-trusted-access.html）<br>Getting started with Cost Optimization Hub - AWS Cost Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/coh-getting-started.html）<br>CUR report for Organisation | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QURjr672h1QPGj4ja2fGGnRA/cur-report-for-organisation）<br>

<br>The correct combination of steps to resolve the issue is B, D, and E. Option B involves updating the CloudFormation template to include the CloudWatch agent, which can monitor the health of the application running on the EC2 instances. Option D involves setting up an alarm in CloudWatch that triggers when the custom metric, indicative of the application's failure, is reached. This alarm can be configured to send a message to an SNS topic. Option E involves creating a Lambda function that is triggered by the SNS message. This function can then execute the logic required to update the network routes to point to the new instance launched by the Auto Scaling group, ensuring that the traffic is directed to the healthy instance.<br>- B: Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent to monitor the application process and send custom metrics to CloudWatch. This ensures we detect software failures, not just EC2-level issues. &nbsp;<br>- D: Create a CloudWatch alarm for the custom metric (application failure) and configure it to publish to an SNS topic. This triggers a notification when the software fails. &nbsp;<br>- E: Use a Lambda function subscribed to the SNS topic to update network routes when a replacement instance is launched. This ensures traffic is redirected properly. &nbsp;<br> Why not the others?<br>- A: EC2 status checks only detect instance-level failures, not application-level failures. &nbsp;<br>- C: Systems Manager Agent (SSM) is useful for management but not directly for triggering Auto Scaling or route updates. &nbsp;<br>- F: CloudFormation conditions are evaluated at stack creation/update, not dynamically during Auto Scaling events. &nbsp;<br>Thus, B, D, E is the correct combination.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer. Using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) is suitable for handling HTTPS traffic, which is required by the application. The blue/green deployment type ensures that updates can be implemented with minimal downtime. Service Auto Scaling, as mentioned in option D, allows each ECS service to automatically adjust the number of tasks in response to CloudWatch alarms, which aligns with the requirement for automatic scaling based on traffic demand. The Cluster Autoscaler is not needed for ECS services running on AWS Fargate, as Fargate manages the infrastructure scaling automatically.<br>1. Blue/Green Deployment with ECS: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS supports blue/green deployments natively in Amazon ECS when using CodeDeploy. This allows traffic to be shifted gradually between the old (blue) and new (green) versions of the service.<br> &nbsp; - The Application Load Balancer (ALB) is required (not Network Load Balancer) because it supports path-based routing, host-based routing, and integration with ECS blue/green deployments via CodeDeploy.<br>2. Application Load Balancer (ALB) vs. Network Load Balancer (NLB): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The question mentions the application uses HTTPS, which is best suited for ALB (Layer 7 load balancing) rather than NLB (Layer 4). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - ALB also integrates seamlessly with ECS blue/green deployments.<br>3. Auto Scaling for ECS Services: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Service Auto Scaling (using Target Tracking Policies or Step Scaling) is the correct way to automatically adjust the number of tasks in response to a CloudWatch alarm. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The Cluster Autoscaler (mentioned in options B and C) is used for scaling the underlying EC2 instances in an ECS cluster (if using EC2 launch type), but the question specifies AWS Fargate, which is serverless and does not require EC2 scaling. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Service Auto Scaling is the proper way to scale tasks (containers) in Fargate.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A & B: Incorrect because they suggest using a Network Load Balancer (NLB), which is not optimal for HTTPS-based microservices (ALB is better for Layer 7 traffic). &nbsp;<br>- B & C: Incorrect because they mention Cluster Autoscaler, which is irrelevant for Fargate (only applies to EC2 launch type). &nbsp;<br>- C: Incorrect because it suggests using the Cluster Autoscaler instead of Service Auto Scaling.<br> Final Answer:<br>D.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer. It provides an automated solution where the scan on push is configured for the ECR repository, and Amazon EventBridge is used to trigger a Step Functions state machine upon completion of the scan. If the scan identifies Critical or High severity issues, the state machine can then execute steps to delete the problematic image tag and notify the development team via Amazon SNS. This approach ensures that the process is automatic, efficient, and provides clear communication to the development team about the action taken.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Scan new image versions for vulnerabilities – This is achieved by enabling scan on push in Amazon ECR. &nbsp;<br>2. Automatically delete image tags with Critical/High severity findings – Amazon EventBridge can detect scan completion events and trigger a Step Functions workflow to delete the image tag. &nbsp;<br>3. Notify the development team – The Step Functions workflow can use Amazon SNS to send notifications. &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is correct: &nbsp;<br>- Scan on push ensures images are scanned immediately upon upload. &nbsp;<br>- EventBridge can capture the ECR Image Scan event and trigger Step Functions when Critical/High findings are detected. &nbsp;<br>- Step Functions can orchestrate both the deletion of the image tag and sending an SNS notification. &nbsp;<br> Why other options are incorrect: &nbsp;<br>- B: While SQS can be used, it adds unnecessary complexity compared to EventBridge. Also, SES is not the best choice for real-time notifications (SNS is preferred). &nbsp;<br>- C: Manual scanning every hour is inefficient and does not guarantee immediate action on new image uploads. &nbsp;<br>- D: Periodic scans (instead of scan-on-push) introduce delays, and using SQS + SES is less efficient than EventBridge + SNS. &nbsp;<br>Thus, Option A is the most efficient and fully automated solution. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the scenario where a company runs workloads on EC2, Fargate, and Lambda with unpredictable demand across AWS Organizations, the solution that will provide the MOST cost savings is:<br>B. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan for the organization from the management account by using the recommendation at the management account level.<br>This is the correct choice because:<br>Compute Savings Plans offer the most flexibility across the company's diverse compute services (EC2, Fargate, and Lambda). Unlike Reserved Instances which only apply to EC2, Compute Savings Plans automatically apply to all eligible compute usage regardless of service type.<br>Compute Savings Plans are ideal for workloads with unpredictable demand, as mentioned in the scenario. They provide discounts in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) rather than committing to specific instance types or configurations.<br>When purchased at the organization level from the management account, Compute Savings Plans automatically apply across all member accounts. This provides maximum flexibility as usage can shift between accounts without losing the discount benefits.<br>For workloads that vary month to month (high usage in some months, low in others), Compute Savings Plans will automatically apply to whatever eligible compute resources are being used, maximizing the utilization of the commitment.<br>Option A (Reserved Instances at the organization level) would be less effective because:<br>Reserved Instances only apply to EC2, not Fargate or Lambda<br>They are less flexible for unpredictable workloads as they're tied to specific instance families and sizes<br>They would require more management to ensure full utilization<br>Option C (Reserved Instances for individual member accounts) would be the least effective because:<br>It doesn't allow for sharing discounts across accounts when usage patterns shift<br>It requires more management overhead<br>It doesn't cover Fargate or Lambda usage<br>Compute Savings Plans at the organization level provide the optimal balance of flexibility, coverage across multiple compute services, and administrative simplicity for the company's diverse and unpredictable workloads.<br>Sources<br>Optimize spending for Windows on Amazon EC2 - AWS Prescriptive Guidance（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/optimize-costs-microsoft-workloads/savings-plans.html） <br>COST07-BP01 Perform pricing model analysis - Cost Optimization Pillar （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/cost_pricing_model_analysis.html）<br>COST07-BP01 Perform pricing model analysis - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost_pricing_model_analysis.html）<br>My boss asking me on cost optimization in AWS | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU3MV37BYRR6ePI6WmUgOW0g/my-boss-asking-me-on-cost-optimization-in-aws）<br>

<br>Option A is the correct answer. AWS Budgets can be used to create a budget for the organization's AWS costs with a daily time period. By setting an alert threshold at 80% of the allocated budget, the finance team can be notified when costs are approaching the limit. Amazon SNS can be used to send email notifications to the finance team when the threshold is breached, providing a direct and automated method for cost monitoring and alerting.<br>AWS Budgets is the most appropriate service for this scenario because it allows you to: &nbsp;<br>- Set custom budgets to track costs across an entire AWS Organization. &nbsp;<br>- Define alert thresholds (e.g., 80% of the daily budget). &nbsp;<br>- Configure notifications via Amazon SNS to alert the finance team when costs exceed the threshold. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- B: AWS Trusted Advisor’s organizational view does not provide real-time budget alerts based on a percentage threshold. It focuses on cost optimization recommendations, not budget tracking. &nbsp;<br>- C: AWS Control Tower’s guardrails are not designed for daily budget tracking with percentage-based alerts. They enforce compliance rules rather than financial thresholds. &nbsp;<br>- D: While technically possible, this solution is overly complex compared to AWS Budgets, which provides built-in budget tracking and alerting without requiring manual queries or additional services like Athena and EventBridge. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option A is the simplest and most effective solution for tracking AWS costs and sending notifications when they exceed 80% of the daily budget. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Configure the buckets to use S3 Transfer Acceleration.<br>This solution will best improve the performance of the image upload process for users in Europe for the following reasons:<br>S3 Transfer Acceleration is specifically designed to optimize long-distance transfers between clients and S3 buckets, which directly addresses the problem of European users experiencing slow upload performance to a bucket in us-east-1.<br>It works by utilizing Amazon's global network of edge locations to route data more efficiently. When users in Europe upload files with Transfer Acceleration enabled, their data is routed through the nearest AWS edge location in Europe and then transferred to the destination bucket in us-east-1 using optimized network paths.<br>S3 Transfer Acceleration can improve upload speeds by 50-500% for long-distance transfers of larger files, which is particularly relevant for the "large-size, high-resolution image files" mentioned in the scenario.<br>It's designed specifically to minimize latency caused by geographic distance, which is the core issue in this scenario (European users uploading to a US-based bucket).<br>Option A (Redeploy the application to use S3 multipart uploads) would help with reliability and throughput for large files, but it doesn't specifically address the latency issues caused by geographic distance. While multipart uploads allow parallel uploading of parts, the data still needs to travel the same distance.<br>Option B (Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution and point to the application as a custom origin) is not appropriate for this scenario. CloudFront is primarily designed for content delivery (downloads) rather than uploads. It helps accelerate content delivery to users but doesn't provide the same benefits for upload acceleration.<br>S3 Transfer Acceleration is the most appropriate solution as it's specifically designed to address the exact problem described in the scenario - improving upload performance over long geographic distances for large files.<br>Sources<br>Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to Minimize Latency Caused by Distance - Best Practices Design Patterns: Optimizing Amazon S3 Performance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html）<br>Looking to compare and understand S3 transfer accelerator vs batch operations vs AWS Backup for S3 | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUFnrSpEOdQ_mZuGpL2iQxVw/looking-to-compare-and-understand-s3-transfer-accelerator-vs-batch-operations-vs-aws-backup-for-s3）<br>I am getting very low speed while uploading data to AWS S3 deep archive storage class | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUCyvqCmNLQVGFCjZcz147-Q/i-am-getting-very-low-speed-while-uploading-data-to-aws-s3-deep-archive-storage-class）<br>Performance guidelines for Amazon S3 - Amazon Simple Storage Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance-guidelines.html）<br>Using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to Accelerate Geographically Disparate Data Transfers - Best Practices Design Patterns: Optimizing Amazon S3 Performance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html）<br>S3 Transfer Rates Capped at 2.8mb/s ???

<br>Option D is the correct answer. Deploying the application on Amazon EKS allows for container orchestration and scaling, which is essential for fault tolerance and scalability. Using managed node groups simplifies cluster management. Storing session data in DynamoDB ensures that it is highly available and scalable, while using EFS for shared application data provides a file system that can be mounted by all application pods. This combination of services offers a robust and scalable solution with minimal operational overhead.<br>Analysis of Options:<br> Option A:<br>- Uses Amazon ECS on Fargate (serverless, low operational overhead).<br>- Uses Amazon EFS for shared data (good for frequently accessed data).<br>- Problem: Amazon SQS is not suitable for session persistence (SQS is a queueing service, not a session store). This does not meet the session persistence requirement.<br> Option B:<br>- Uses Amazon ECS on EC2 (requires managing EC2 instances, higher operational overhead).<br>- Uses ElastiCache for Redis (good for session persistence).<br>- Problem: Amazon EBS with Multi-Attach is not a good solution for shared storage across Availability Zones (EBS volumes are AZ-bound and Multi-Attach is limited to a single AZ). This does not meet fault tolerance requirements.<br> Option C:<br>- Uses Amazon EKS with managed node groups (reduces operational overhead).<br>- Uses EFS for shared storage (good for frequently accessed data).<br>- Problem: EFS is not ideal for session persistence (high latency compared to in-memory solutions like ElastiCache or DynamoDB).

When data replication is finished, transition the workload to an Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB instance.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Near-Zero Downtime: Using native SQL Server high availability tools with direct replication to RDS SQL Server provides a continuous replication stream between the on-premises source and the AWS target. This approach minimizes downtime during the migration process, as the databases remain operational throughout most of the migration.<br>Modern Data Architecture: By migrating directly to Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, the solution moves the legacy databases to a managed database service. RDS provides modern features like automated backups, patching, monitoring, and high availability options, which helps modernize the data architecture.<br>Streamlined Process: This approach involves a more direct path to the target state (RDS SQL Server) without intermediate steps, reducing complexity and potential points of failure.<br>Familiar Tools: Using native SQL Server replication capabilities leverages existing database expertise and provides a well-established migration path that's proven for critical database migrations.<br>Option D (using AWS Application Migration Service) has several disadvantages for this specific scenario:<br>It involves a two-step process: first rehosting on EC2, then moving to RDS. This adds complexity and potential for additional downtime during the second step.<br>The process of detaching the database from EC2 and reattaching it to RDS would likely cause more downtime than a properly configured replication approach.<br>While AWS Application Migration Service is excellent for rehosting entire servers, it's not the most efficient approach when the end goal is specifically to migrate databases to RDS.<br>The native database high availability tools approach provides a more direct path to the target state with near-zero downtime, which is critical for the migration of these legacy SQL Server databases.

<br>Question #230<br>A company's solutions architect is analyzing costs of a multi-application environment. The environment is deployed across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region. After a recent acquisition, the company manages two organizations in AWS Organizations. The company has created multiple service provider applications as AWS PrivateLink-powered VPC endpoint services in one organization. The company has created multiple service consumer applications in the other organization. Data transfer charges are much higher than the company expected, and the solutions architect needs to reduce the costs. The solutions architect must recommend guidelines for developers to follow when they deploy services. These guidelines must minimize data transfer charges for the whole environment. Which guidelines meet these requirements? (Choose two.)<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">CD</span>
<br>The company faces high data transfer charges due to multi-application deployments across two AWS Organizations and multiple Availability Zones (AZs). The service provider applications (using AWS PrivateLink VPC endpoint services) and service consumer applications reside in different organizations, potentially incurring cross-organization or cross-AZ data transfer costs. &nbsp;<br><br><br> Correct Options &nbsp;<br><br><br> C. Turn off cross-zone load balancing for the Network Load Balancer in all service provider application deployments. &nbsp;<br>- Rationale: Cross-zone load balancing on a Network Load Balancer (NLB) distributes traffic across instances in different AZs, causing data transfer between AZs. Disabling this feature restricts traffic to the local AZ, minimizing cross-AZ data transfer charges. &nbsp;<br>- Cost Impact: Cross-AZ data transfer within a Region incurs fees. By limiting traffic to the local AZ, the company reduces unnecessary inter-AZ bandwidth usage. &nbsp;<br><br><br> D. Ensure that service consumer compute resources use the Availability Zone-specific endpoint service by using the endpoint's local DNS name. &nbsp;<br>- Rationale: Using the AZ-specific local DNS name for the VPC endpoint ensures that service consumers connect to the endpoint in their own AZ. This avoids cross-AZ traffic between consumers and providers, reducing data transfer costs. &nbsp;<br>- Cost Impact: Connecting to the local AZ endpoint prevents inter-AZ data transfer, which is a key source of high charges in multi-AZ environments. &nbsp;<br><br><br> Incorrect Options &nbsp;<br><br><br> B. Place the service provider applications and the service consumer applications in AWS accounts in the same organization. &nbsp;<br>- Issue: While AWS Organizations can simplify account management, data transfer between AWS accounts in the same Region—even across different organizations—via PrivateLink VPC endpoints is typically free. The primary cost driver here is cross-AZ traffic, not cross-organization account traffic. &nbsp;<br>- Why It's Not Optimal: PrivateLink within a Region does not charge for data transfer between accounts, regardless of organizational boundaries. Thus, reorganizing accounts does not address the core cost issue. &nbsp;<br><br><br> Key Takeaway &nbsp;<br>To minimize data transfer costs, focus on reducing cross-AZ traffic by disabling cross-zone load balancing (C) and using AZ-specific endpoints (D). These steps target the primary cost drivers in multi-AZ deployments without requiring organizational restructuring.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Create a new S3 bucket. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway within the VPC that is connected to the Direct Connect connection. Create a new SMB file share. Write nightly database exports to the new SMB file share.<br>This solution meets the requirements most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>Direct Path to S3: AWS Storage Gateway file gateway provides a direct path for storing the SQL Server exports in Amazon S3, which is the company's stated goal for "robust cloud storage." The file gateway acts as an intermediary that presents an SMB file share interface to the on-premises SQL Server while automatically transferring the data to S3.<br>Cost-Effective Storage: Amazon S3 offers significantly lower storage costs compared to file system storage options like FSx for Windows File Server, especially for this use case where the data is primarily for backup purposes rather than active file serving.<br>Efficient Use of Existing Infrastructure: The solution leverages the company's existing 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection, allowing for efficient data transfer from on-premises to AWS without additional networking costs.<br>Minimal Operational Overhead: Once configured, the file gateway requires minimal management, as it automatically handles the transfer of data from the SMB share to S3.<br>Compatibility with Existing Workflows: The SQL Server can continue writing exports to an SMB file share, which is a familiar protocol in Windows environments, requiring no changes to the existing export process.<br>Option B (using Amazon FSx for Windows File Server) would be less cost-effective because:<br>FSx for Windows File Server is designed as a high-performance file system for active workloads, which is unnecessary for nightly database exports.<br>FSx storage costs are higher than S3 storage costs, especially for data that doesn't require the performance characteristics of a Windows file system.<br>The solution would require an additional step to move the data from FSx to S3 if the ultimate goal is S3 storage, adding complexity and potential costs.<br>Enabling nightly backups of FSx would add another layer of storage costs that isn't necessary when the data can be stored directly in S3.<br>The AWS Storage Gateway file gateway solution provides the most direct and cost-effective path to meet the company's requirement of moving their SQL Server exports to robust cloud storage on Amazon S3.<br>Sources<br>Using the S3 File Gateway as an Enterprise SMB File Server | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU_XkS2prlSwC_5oAQBD0kcQ/using-the-s3-file-gateway-as-an-enterprise-smb-file-server）<br>AWS Storage Gateway - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/optimize-costs-microsoft-workloads/storage-main-storage-gateway.html）<br>Writing to AWS from a Windows legacy app that supports only Network Paths for exports? | AWS re:Post（https://repost.aws/questions/QUJnyObhgiQhyWmvoqgVj8FA/writing-to-aws-from-a-windows-legacy-app-that-supports-only-network-paths-for-exports） <br>Please help me choose the right Amazon service(s) | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUjGbInOcSSAWwhvHUFz8PzA/please-help-me-choose-the-right-amazon-service-s）<br>S3 File Gateway file limit per SMB share | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUkeYgQIC8S1SLAv--BfMP4w/s3-file-gateway-file-limit-per-smb-share）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided and security best practices, the correct answer is:<br>D. Create an IAM user in the management account. In the member accounts, create cross-account roles that have least privilege access. Grant the IAM user access to the roles by using a trust policy.<br>This solution will meet the requirement for the following reasons:<br>Proper Separation of Concerns: This approach maintains proper separation between the management account and member accounts, which is a security best practice in AWS Organizations.<br>Principle of Least Privilege: By creating specific cross-account roles in each member account (development and production), you can define precise permissions that follow the principle of least privilege. Each role can be tailored to include only the permissions needed to stop or terminate resources in that specific account.<br>Trust Relationship: The trust policy in each member account's role explicitly defines which entities (in this case, the IAM user in the management account) are allowed to assume the role, providing clear access control.<br>Reduced Risk: This approach reduces risk by not creating roles with cross-account access in the management account, which could potentially grant excessive permissions if compromised.<br>Better Auditability: When the IAM user assumes a role in a member account, AWS CloudTrail logs will clearly show which user performed actions in which account, improving auditability and compliance.<br>Option A (creating an IAM user and a cross-account role in the management account) is not the correct approach because:<br>It doesn't follow AWS best practices for cross-account access. The standard pattern is to create roles in the accounts where resources need to be accessed, not in the account where the user exists.<br>A cross-account role in the management account wouldn't have direct access to resources in member accounts without additional complex permission configurations.<br>This approach would be more difficult to audit and could potentially lead to privilege escalation issues.<br>The correct solution (Option D) follows AWS security best practices by implementing a clear separation of duties, maintaining the principle of least privilege, and establishing explicit trust relationships between accounts, while still allowing the IAM user in the management account to perform the required actions in both member accounts.<br>Sources<br>Secure root user access for member accounts in AWS Organizations | AWS Security Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/security/secure-root-user-access-for-member-accounts-in-aws-organizations/）<br>Managing access permissions for an organization with AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions_overview.html） <br>IAM tutorial: Delegate access across AWS accounts using IAM roles - AWS Identity and Access Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html）<br>WHY AWS Account is not relative each login? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUuVhhDp6ZS4CX1I8M_jSCzA/why-aws-account-is-not-relative-each-login）<br>AWS Organizations - Organizing Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/aws-organizations.html）<br>

<br>Option D is the correct answer. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery is designed to replicate servers to AWS with minimal downtime, which aligns with the company's RTO and RPO requirements. By replicating data to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and using AWS DataSync, the company can ensure that the data is up-to-date and that there is a robust failover and fallback process in place. This solution also supports native failover and fallback capabilities, which is a requirement specified by the company.<br>The requirements include: &nbsp;<br>- RTO of 15 minutes and RPO of 5 minutes (fast recovery and minimal data loss). &nbsp;<br>- Native failover and fallback capabilities. &nbsp;<br>- Hundreds of Windows servers with a common share. &nbsp;<br>Option D meets these requirements most effectively and cost-efficiently: &nbsp;<br>- AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) provides continuous replication of on-premises servers to AWS, enabling fast failover (meeting RTO/RPO). &nbsp;<br>- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed shared file storage solution compatible with Windows servers. &nbsp;<br>- AWS DataSync efficiently replicates data to FSx. &nbsp;<br>- Native failover and fallback are supported by Elastic Disaster Recovery. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Storage Gateway + S3 backups do not meet the RTO/RPO requirements (slow recovery). &nbsp;<br>- B: CloudFormation + EFS + DataSync is complex and does not provide native failover/fallback for Windows servers. &nbsp;<br>- C: Multi-site active-active is expensive and overkill; `s3 sync` is not real-time enough for a 5-minute RPO. &nbsp;<br>Thus, D is the most cost-effective and compliant solution. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Use an SCP to deny the creation of resources that do not have the required tags. Create a tag policy that includes the tag values that the company has assigned to each OU. Attach the tag policies to the OUs.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce tagging: Using an SCP to deny the creation of resources that don't have required tags ensures compliance with the company's tagging standards. This creates a preventive control that blocks resources from being created without proper tags.<br>Tag policies for defining allowed values: Tag policies are specifically designed to define and enforce standardized tag keys and values across an organization. They allow you to specify which tag keys must be used and what values are allowed for each key.<br>OU-specific tag values: By attaching tag policies to individual OUs rather than the management account, each OU can have its own unique tag values as specified in the requirements. This provides the flexibility needed when different parts of the organization require different tag values.<br>Comprehensive enforcement: The combination of SCPs (to require tags) and tag policies (to define allowed values) creates a complete tagging governance solution that both requires tags and ensures they have appropriate values.<br>Option B would not work because attaching tag policies only to the management account wouldn't allow for unique tag values for each OU. This approach would enforce the same tag values across the entire organization.<br>Option D would not be optimal because using only SCPs without tag policies would make it difficult to define and manage the allowed tag values for each OU. SCPs are primarily access control policies and aren't designed to efficiently manage and enforce specific tag values.<br>The correct solution (Option A) provides both the enforcement mechanism (SCPs) and the value definition capability (tag policies attached to OUs) needed to meet the company's requirements for standardized tagging with OU-specific values.<br>Sources<br>AWS Organizations – Tag policies - Best Practices for Tagging AWS Resources (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/aws-organizations-tag-policies.html)<br>AWS Organizations tag policies - Tagging AWS Resources and Tag Editor (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tag-policies-orgs.html)<br>Tag policies - AWS Organizations (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html)<br>Measure, enforce, and evolve - AWS Prescriptive Guidance (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cost-allocation-tagging/measure-enforce-evolve.html)<br>Using TagOptions with AWS Organizations tag policies - AWS Service Catalog (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/tagoption-policies.html)<br>

<br>The combination of steps that will meet the requirements with the least amount of operational overhead is A, B, and D.<br>A. Creating an AWS Backup plan with custom backup rules allows the company to meet the regulatory and business requirements for backup retention schedules.<br>B. Configuring the AWS Backup plan to copy backups to another Region ensures that backups are replicated immediately after capture, providing data protection and disaster recovery capabilities.<br>D. Adding an Amazon SNS topic to the backup plan enables immediate notifications to be sent upon the failure of any resource backup, allowing for quick response to any issues.<br>Option C is not necessary because AWS Backup can be configured to send notifications directly through the service. Option E is not required as AWS Backup can also handle the creation and lifecycle of EBS snapshots, and Amazon DLM is more focused on EBS snapshots rather than a comprehensive backup solution. Option F is not needed because AWS Backup can be used to automate RDS snapshot creation and management.<br>The question asks for the LEAST amount of operational overhead while meeting all the given backup requirements. The best approach is to use AWS Backup, as it provides a centralized backup solution for EC2, EFS, and RDS, along with cross-region replication, customizable retention policies, and notifications.<br> Correct Answers:<br>A. Create an AWS Backup plan with a backup rule for each of the retention requirements. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Backup allows you to define multiple backup rules with different retention periods (daily, weekly, monthly). &nbsp;<br>- This meets the requirement for custom retention policies.<br>B. Configure an AWS Backup plan to copy backups to another Region. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Backup supports cross-region copy, which automatically replicates backups to another Region. &nbsp;<br>- This meets the requirement for immediate replication.<br>D. Add an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to the backup plan to send a notification for finished jobs that have any status except BACKUP_JOB_COMPLETED. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Backup integrates with SNS to send notifications on backup failures. &nbsp;<br>- This meets the requirement for immediate failure notifications.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- C. Lambda function for replication & notifications → Adds unnecessary complexity since AWS Backup natively supports these features.<br>- E. Amazon DLM policies → Only works for EBS snapshots (not RDS or EFS) and lacks centralized management.<br>- F.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams can collect and process large volumes of genomic data in near-real-time. By using Kinesis clients, the data can be analyzed as it streams in. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that can handle large-scale data analytics and is suitable for storing and querying the processed genomic data. Using Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) can provide additional processing power for complex analytics if needed.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Near-real-time analytics: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed for real-time data ingestion and processing. &nbsp;<br>2. Flexible, parallel, and durable data: Kinesis Data Streams allows multiple consumers (Kinesis clients) to process data in parallel, and it is durable. &nbsp;<br>3. Deliver results to a data warehouse: Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse, and Amazon EMR can be used to process and load data into it. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Amazon RDS is not a data warehouse solution like Redshift, and Kinesis Data Firehose is more for batch processing rather than real-time analytics. &nbsp;<br>- C: Amazon S3 is for storage, not real-time processing. SQS + Kinesis is not a typical pattern for real-time genomic data streaming. &nbsp;<br>- D: API Gateway + SQS + Lambda is more suited for request/response workloads, not continuous real-time data streaming. &nbsp;<br>

<br> The combination of steps that will meet the requirements is B, C, and E.<br>B. Using an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy with a TTL of 30 seconds allows for quick DNS failover to the disaster recovery Region in case of a primary Region failure.<br>C. Implementing a global table within Amazon DynamoDB ensures that data is replicated and accessible in both the primary and disaster recovery Regions, which supports high availability and disaster recovery.<br>E. A hot standby model with Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones provides high availability within an AWS Region and can quickly adapt to demand changes while using a mix of Reserved Instances and On-Demand Instances for cost efficiency.<br>Option A is not suitable due to the long TTL, which would delay failover. Option D is not the most efficient solution for disaster recovery as it relies on backups and manual data import scripts. Option F does not meet the requirement for high availability within an AWS Region as Spot Instances can be terminated with little notice, which could impact the availability of the application.<br>- B (Route 53 Failover Routing Policy with 30s TTL): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Enables fast failover (within 1 minute) by quickly redirecting traffic to the standby region. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- A low TTL (30s) ensures DNS changes propagate quickly. &nbsp;<br>- C (DynamoDB Global Table): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Provides multi-region replication for NoSQL data, ensuring the disaster recovery region has real-time access to data. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Eliminates manual backup/restore delays, improving recovery time. &nbsp;<br>- E (Hot Standby with Auto Scaling & Reserved/On-Demand Instances): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- A hot standby model ensures resources are running in the DR region, allowing quick failover. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Reserved Instances for baseline capacity + On-Demand for scaling balances cost and availability. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Others? &nbsp;<br>- A: Weighted routing (100/0) does not support automatic failover. &nbsp;<br>- D: Backing up DynamoDB every 60 minutes is too slow (RTO &gt; 1 minute). &nbsp;<br>- F: Spot Instances are unreliable for DR since they can be interrupted. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B, C, E provide high availability, fast failover (&lt;1 min), and minimal user impact while being cost-efficient. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Question #241<br>A company manufactures smart vehicles. The company uses a custom application to collect vehicle data. The vehicles use the MQTT protocol to connect to the application. The company processes the data in 5-minute intervals. The company then copies vehicle telematics data to on-premises storage. <br><br>Custom applications analyze this data to detect anomalies. The number of vehicles that send data grows constantly. Newer vehicles generate high volumes of data.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. AWS IoT Core is designed to handle the ingestion of data from IoT devices at scale, which is ideal for the growing number of smart vehicles sending data. By routing the data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the company can efficiently store the large volumes of data in Amazon S3. Additionally, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics can be used to analyze the data stream for anomaly detection, which provides a scalable and serverless solution with minimal operational overhead. This approach leverages managed services and does not require the management of clusters or Kafka applications, which simplifies operations and reduces overhead compared to the other options.<br>1. AWS IoT Core natively supports MQTT, which the vehicles already use, minimizing changes to the existing setup.<br>2. Kinesis Data Firehose automatically scales to handle high data volumes and stores data directly in Amazon S3 without manual intervention.<br>3. Kinesis Data Analytics can process streaming data in real-time (or near-real-time) to detect anomalies, aligning with the 5-minute processing interval.<br>4. This approach is serverless, meaning AWS manages scaling, reducing operational overhead.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A: Uses AWS IoT Greengrass (requires edge deployment) and Amazon MSK (Kafka cluster management adds complexity).<br>- C: AWS IoT FleetWise is more specialized for automotive data collection but introduces unnecessary complexity compared to IoT Core.<br>- D: Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ is not optimized for IoT use cases like AWS IoT Core, and Lookout for Metrics is more for time-series anomaly detection rather than telemetry analysis.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option B provides a scalable, serverless, and low-operational-overhead solution by leveraging AWS IoT Core, Kinesis Firehose, and Kinesis Analytics. <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Configure a CodeCommit trigger to invoke an AWS Lambda function to scan new code submissions for credentials. If credentials are found, disable them in AWS IAM and notify the user.<br>This solution will ensure that credentials are appropriately secured automatically for the following reasons:<br>Real-time Detection: CodeCommit triggers activate immediately when new code is submitted, allowing for instant scanning of code for IAM credentials. This provides the fastest possible detection compared to scheduled or periodic scanning approaches.<br>Immediate Remediation: When credentials are found, they are disabled in IAM right away, minimizing the window of vulnerability. This is critical for security since exposed credentials could be exploited quickly.<br>User Notification: Notifying the user who committed the code creates awareness and provides an opportunity for education about secure coding practices, helping prevent similar issues in the future.<br>Preventive Approach: This solution prevents the exposed credentials from being used maliciously by disabling them as soon as they're detected, rather than just identifying them or rotating them while they remain exposed.<br>Automation: The entire process is automated from detection to remediation, requiring no manual intervention.<br>Option A (using Systems Manager Run Command with nightly scripts) would be less effective because:<br>Nightly scans create a potential 24-hour window where credentials could be exposed and exploited<br>It doesn't include notification to users who committed the credentials<br>It focuses on development instances rather than the source code repository itself<br>Option B (scheduled Lambda function to scan CodeCommit) would be less effective because:<br>Scheduled scans may miss credentials between scan intervals<br>Storing credentials in KMS doesn't address the immediate security risk of exposed credentials<br>It doesn't include disabling the compromised credentials or notifying users<br>The CodeCommit trigger with Lambda approach (Option D) provides the most comprehensive solution by combining immediate detection, automatic remediation, and user education, which aligns with security best practices for handling exposed credentials in code repositories.<br>Sources<br>IAM credentials for CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and AWS access keys - AWS Identity and Access Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html）<br>CodeCommit auth fail | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU_8egJwzFRqegRf5zMtsPgw/codecommit-auth-fail）<br>Security best practices in IAM - AWS Identity and Access Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html）<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">AC</span>
<br>The correct answers are A and C. Step A enables each application to have its own access point, which can be configured to allow only the necessary permissions for that application. This satisfies the requirement for least privilege access. Step C involves creating a gateway VPC endpoint for S3 in each application's VPC. This endpoint provides a private path for traffic between the VPC and the S3 bucket, ensuring that the data does not traverse the public internet. The endpoint policy should be configured to allow access to the specific S3 access point created for the application, maintaining the least privilege principle.<br>The requirements are:<br>1. No public internet access to the S3 bucket.<br>2. Minimum permissions for each application.<br>3. Access restricted via VPCs using S3 access points.<br> Option A: Correct<br>- S3 access points are created in the bucket's account (where the data lake resides).<br>- Each access point is restricted to a specific application VPC (using VPC restrictions).<br>- The bucket policy enforces that all access must come through an access point (ensuring no public internet access).<br> Option C: Correct<br>- A gateway endpoint for S3 (type `com.amazonaws.&lt;region&gt;.s3`) is needed in each application's VPC to allow private connectivity to S3.<br>- The endpoint policy can restrict access to only the required S3 access point.<br>- The route table ensures traffic to S3 goes through the gateway endpoint (keeping traffic within AWS network).<br> Why not the others?<br>- B: Incorrect because interface endpoints (PrivateLink) are not needed for S3; gateway endpoints are the correct choice for S3.<br>- D: Incorrect because S3 access points must be created in the bucket's account, not in each application's account.<br>- E: Incorrect because the gateway endpoint should be in each application's VPC, not the data lake's VPC. Also, the policy should allow access to the access point, not the bucket directly.<br> Summary:<br>- A: Sets up VPC-restricted access points in the bucket's account.<br>- C: Configures private connectivity via gateway endpoints in each application's VPC. <br>This ensures private access and least-privilege permissions. ✅<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. This solution involves creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream with Splunk as the destination and configuring a pre-processing AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function is used to process the records from CloudWatch Logs before they are sent to the Kinesis Data Firehose stream.

<br>The correct answer is B. A transit gateway can be used as a hub for network traffic between VPCs and on-premises networks. By creating a transit gateway and sharing it with existing AWS accounts, the architect can attach the VPCs to the transit gateway. This allows for centralized management of routing and ensures that all traffic from spoke VPCs is routed through the egress VPC with the NAT gateway, thus providing internet access in a hub-and-spoke architecture.<br>1. Hub-and-Spoke Design Requirement: The solution requires centralized internet egress through an egress VPC (hub) for all spoke VPCs across multiple AWS accounts.<br>2. Transit Gateway (TGW) Benefits:<br> &nbsp; - Centralized Routing: TGW allows you to connect hundreds of VPCs (spokes) to a central egress VPC (hub) efficiently.<br> &nbsp; - Cross-Account Sharing: You can create the TGW in one account (central account) and share it with other AWS accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM).<br> &nbsp; - Simplified Peering: Instead of managing individual VPC peering connections (which don’t scale well and have routing limitations), TGW provides a scalable and manageable solution.<br>3. Steps:<br> &nbsp; - Deploy a Transit Gateway in the central account (where the egress VPC is located).<br> &nbsp; - Share the TGW with spoke accounts using AWS RAM.<br> &nbsp; - Attach all spoke VPCs and the egress VPC to the TGW.<br> &nbsp; - Configure routing:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Spoke VPCs: Route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the TGW attachment.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - TGW Route Table: Route internet-bound traffic to the egress VPC attachment.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Egress VPC: Ensure the NAT gateway routes traffic to the internet.<br>4. Why Not Other Options?:<br> &nbsp; - A (VPC Peering): Doesn’t scale well for hundreds of VPCs, requires complex routing, and lacks transitive routing.<br> &nbsp; - C (TGW in Every Account): Overly complex and unnecessary; a single shared TGW is sufficient.<br> &nbsp; - D (AWS PrivateLink): PrivateLink is for private connectivity to services, not for internet egress.<br> Key AWS Services Used:<br>- Transit Gateway: For scalable hub-and-spoke connectivity.<br>- AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager): To share the TGW across accounts.<br>- NAT Gateway: For outbound internet access from the egress VPC.<br>This approach ensures scalability, centralized management, and cost efficiency for internet egress across hundreds of accounts.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create an AWS WAF web ACL with a rate-based rule, and set the rule action to Block. Connect the web ACL to the ALB.<br>This solution meets the requirements with the most operational efficiency for the following reasons:<br>Dynamic Protection Against Changing IP Addresses: The scenario specifically mentions that the 500 IP addresses change each week. AWS WAF rate-based rules automatically identify and block IP addresses that exceed a specified request rate, regardless of what those IP addresses are. This eliminates the need to manually update IP address lists weekly.<br>Automatic Adaptation: Rate-based rules automatically adapt to new threat sources without manual intervention. When the weekly spike occurs with new IP addresses, the rate-based rule will detect and block excessive requests from those IPs without requiring updates to the rule.<br>Targeted Protection: AWS WAF can be configured to specifically protect the authentication endpoint that's being overwhelmed, rather than blocking access to the entire application.<br>Operational Efficiency: Once configured, the rate-based rule requires minimal ongoing maintenance. It will continue to function effectively even as the attacking IP addresses change each week, making it highly operationally efficient.<br>Integration with ALB: AWS WAF integrates directly with Application Load Balancers, making implementation straightforward.<br>Option A (using AWS Firewall Manager to create security groups) would be less operationally efficient because:<br>It would require weekly updates to the security group rules to block the new set of 500 IP addresses.<br>Managing a large and constantly changing list of blocked IP addresses would create significant operational overhead.<br>Security groups are not designed for this type of dynamic threat mitigation where the source IPs change frequently.<br>This approach would require creating automation to detect and update the blocked IP addresses, adding complexity.<br>The AWS WAF rate-based rule solution provides an elegant, low-maintenance approach that automatically adapts to the changing threat landscape without requiring weekly manual updates or complex automation. This makes it the most operationally efficient solution for protecting the authentication service from the weekly spikes in failed login attempts.<br>Sources<br>AWS WAF Rate-Based Rule - How to permanently block offending IP addresses? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUyq6dArvCRECG10yKcg6erg/aws-waf-rate-based-rule-how-to-permanently-block-offending-ip-addresses）<br>Allow good bots in WAF rate-based rule | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUNcT9XrO8RaWpMT8RAtO4Vg/allow-good-bots-in-waf-rate-based-rule）<br>AWS WAF – Rate-based rules - AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-waf-rate-based-rules.html）<br>Static controls for managing bots - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/bot-control/static-controls.html）<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer is A. By using AWS Transfer for SFTP, the company can maintain the existing IP addresses by registering them with AWS and assigning Elastic IPs to the SFTP endpoint. This approach allows customers to continue using the same IP addresses in their firewall allow list, satisfying the requirement that changes to the SFTP endpoint IP addresses are not permitted. Additionally, by using AWS Transfer for SFTP, the company can offload the operational overhead of managing an SFTP server to AWS, and leverage Amazon S3 for scalable file storage.<br>1. SFTP endpoints must retain the same IP addresses (changes are not permitted).<br>2. Migrate to AWS and reduce operational overhead.<br>3. Store files in Amazon S3 (implied by the need to migrate SaaS to AWS).<br> Analysis of Options:<br>- Option A (✅ Correct):<br> &nbsp;- Uses AWS Transfer for SFTP, a fully managed SFTP service.<br> &nbsp;- Allows assigning Elastic IPs from a customer-owned IP block (ensuring no IP changes).<br> &nbsp;- Stores files directly in Amazon S3, reducing operational overhead.<br> &nbsp;- Fully managed, so no need to maintain EC2 instances or scaling.<br>- Option B (❌ Incorrect):<br> &nbsp;- Uses EC2 instances with an ALB, which does not support SFTP (ALB works at Layer 7, not SFTP).<br> &nbsp;- Stores files on EBS volumes, which is not scalable and increases management overhead.<br> &nbsp;- ALB does not support static IP assignment (unlike AWS Transfer for SFTP or NLB).<br>- Option C (❌ Incorrect):<br> &nbsp;- Uses Route 53 and NLB, but NLBs do not support SFTP (they operate at Layer 4).<br> &nbsp;- Requires managing EC2 instances, increasing operational overhead.<br> &nbsp;- Route 53 does not solve the IP requirement (customers need static IPs, not DNS).<br>- Option D (❌ Incorrect):<br> &nbsp;- S3 VPC endpoints do not support SFTP (AWS Transfer for SFTP is needed).<br> &nbsp;- S3 does not natively support SFTP (this is a distractor).<br> Conclusion:<br>AWS Transfer for SFTP (Option A) is the only fully managed solution that allows:<br>- Static IP assignment (from customer-owned IP block).<br>- Direct S3 storage (reducing operational overhead).<br>- Native SFTP support without managing servers.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Launch five new EC2 instances into a cluster placement group. Ensure that the EC2 instance type supports enhanced networking.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Cluster Placement Group: A cluster placement group is specifically designed to pack instances close together within a single Availability Zone, providing the lowest possible network latency and highest network throughput between instances. This directly addresses the requirement for "high-throughput, low-latency network connections between all of the EC2 instances."<br>Enhanced Networking: Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. This further improves the network performance between instances, supporting the high-throughput, low-latency requirement.<br>Single Region Deployment: The solution keeps all instances within a single region as specified in the requirements.<br>No Fault Tolerance Requirement: The scenario explicitly states there is no requirement for the application to be fault tolerant. A cluster placement group places all instances in a single Availability Zone, which reduces fault tolerance but maximizes network performance - perfectly aligned with the stated requirements.<br>The other options would not be optimal:<br>B. Auto Scaling group in the same AZ with extra elastic network interfaces - While this keeps instances in the same AZ, it doesn't provide the same level of network optimization as a cluster placement group. Adding extra network interfaces is primarily useful for connecting to different networks, not for improving performance between instances in the same application.<br>C. Partition placement group with enhanced networking - Partition placement groups are designed to spread instances across distinct racks (partitions), which is useful for distributed applications that need to reduce correlated failures. This doesn't optimize for the lowest possible latency between all instances.<br>D. Spread placement group with extra network interfaces - Spread placement groups place instances on distinct underlying hardware to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures. This actually increases the physical distance between instances, which would likely increase latency rather than decrease it.<br>Option A provides the optimal solution for maximizing network performance between the five EC2 instances without concern for fault tolerance.<br>Sources<br>PERF04-BP06 Choose your workload's location based on network requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2024-06-27/framework/perf_networking_choose_workload_location_network_requirements.html）<br>Placement Groups Latency | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUz8Qi26ZfSZi6oeRtwRKfgQ/placement-groups-latency）<br>Optimize network performance on EC2 Windows instances - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-os.html）<br>Benchmark network throughput between Linux instances in the same VPC | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/network-throughput-benchmark-linux-ec2）<br>PERF04-BP06 Choose your workload's location based on network requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-10-03/framework/perf_networking_choose_workload_location_network_requirements.html）<br>

<br>The correct answer is D. To secure the API from the botnet traffic, the company can use AWS WAF to create a web ACL that allows only the known IP addresses of the six partners. Additionally, by creating a usage plan with a request limit in API Gateway and requiring an API key for the POST method, the company can ensure that only authorized requests are processed, and it can limit the rate of requests to prevent the botnet traffic from overwhelming the API.<br>1. Requirements:<br> &nbsp; - The company has a Regional API Gateway endpoint.<br> &nbsp; - Only 6 partners (with known IPs) should access the API once per day.<br> &nbsp; - There is malicious traffic (botnet) from 500+ IPs worldwide making 1000 requests/sec.<br> &nbsp; - The goal is to secure the API while minimizing cost.<br>2. Key Security Measures Needed:<br> &nbsp; - Restrict access to only the 6 partners' IPs (whitelisting).<br> &nbsp; - Limit request rates to prevent abuse.<br> &nbsp; - Use API keys for additional authentication.<br> Why Option D is Correct:<br>- AWS WAF Web ACL with IP Allow List:<br> &nbsp;- Blocks all traffic except from the 6 partners' IPs.<br> &nbsp;- Effectively stops botnet traffic.<br>- Usage Plan with Request Limit:<br> &nbsp;- Enforces a rate limit (e.g., 1 request/day per partner).<br> &nbsp;- Prevents abuse even if IP whitelisting fails.<br>- API Key:<br> &nbsp;- Adds an extra layer of authentication.<br> &nbsp;- The key is added to the usage plan, ensuring only authorized clients can call the API.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- Option A & B (CloudFront + WAF + OAI/API Key):<br> &nbsp;- CloudFront is unnecessary since the API is Regional (not global).<br> &nbsp;- Overcomplicates the solution and increases cost.<br>- Option C (WAF + Resource Policy + API Key):<br> &nbsp;- Resource policies are for cross-account access or IP-based restrictions, but WAF already handles IP whitelisting.<br> &nbsp;- A usage plan (Option D) is better for rate-limiting than a resource policy.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option D is the most cost-effective and secure solution, combining IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and API key authentication.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>The correct answer is C. Given that the company's analysis showed that the initially deployed instances were only utilizing a quarter of their CPU and memory capacity, it would be cost-inefficient to maintain the same instance size. By choosing option C, the company can downscale to a more appropriate instance size that matches the current demand while still providing memory-optimized performance. The Auto Scaling group can then adjust the number of instances between the minimum of 3 and the maximum of 12 based on actual CPU and memory consumption, which aligns with the company's need for a cost-effective and responsive scaling strategy.The original workload ran on memory-optimized instances with low utilization, so downsizing to `r6g.4xlarge` is appropriate. Auto Scaling with a minimum of 3 instances ensures baseline capacity, while scaling up to 12 handles spikes cost-effectively.<br>Option A: `c6g.4xlarge` (Compute Optimized)<br> &nbsp; - Problem: The workload was originally on memory-optimized instances, and memory utilization was low but still a factor. Switching to compute-optimized instances may not be appropriate if memory is still a consideration. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Not the best choice. &nbsp;<br> Option B: `m6g.4xlarge` (General Purpose)<br> &nbsp; - Problem: While general-purpose instances balance CPU and memory, the workload was initially on memory-optimized instances. If memory is a key factor, general-purpose may not be optimal. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Not the best choice. &nbsp;<br> Option C: `r6g.4xlarge` (Memory Optimized)<br> &nbsp; - Pros: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Memory-optimized, matching the original instance family. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Smaller size (`4xlarge` vs `16xlarge`) reduces cost while still providing sufficient memory. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Scaling (3–12 instances) allows flexibility for variable demand. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Best choice if memory is still a key requirement. &nbsp;<br> Option D: `r6g.8xlarge` (Memory Optimized)<br> &nbsp; - Pros: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Still memory-optimized. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Cons: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Larger instance size (`8xlarge`) may still be over-provisioned given the previous low utilization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Fewer instances (2–6) means less granular scaling, potentially leading to less cost efficiency. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Deploy DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). Use provisioned capacity mode. Configure DynamoDB auto scaling.<br>This strategy will best reduce costs associated with DynamoDB for the financial services company's specific usage pattern for the following reasons:<br>DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX):<br>The company's workload has "bursts throughout the day, and a limited set of keys are repeatedly looked up." This is an ideal use case for DAX, which provides in-memory caching specifically designed for DynamoDB.<br>DAX can significantly reduce the number of read requests that hit the DynamoDB table by caching frequently accessed items, which directly reduces costs since DynamoDB charges per request.<br>For the "limited set of keys" that are "repeatedly looked up," DAX will provide microsecond response times while dramatically reducing the read capacity required from the main DynamoDB table.<br>Provisioned Capacity Mode:<br>The company's usage pattern is relatively predictable: millions of historical records with a few million new records loaded once daily at midnight, and bursty but predictable read patterns.<br>Provisioned capacity mode is more cost-effective than on-demand capacity mode for predictable workloads, as it allows you to pay for reserved capacity at a lower rate than on-demand pricing.<br>Since the company knows approximately when and how much data will be loaded (at midnight each day), they can provision appropriate write capacity for this predictable spike.<br>DynamoDB Auto Scaling:<br>Auto scaling allows the provisioned capacity to adjust automatically based on actual usage, which addresses the "bursts throughout the day" in read activity.<br>This prevents over-provisioning during low-usage periods while ensuring sufficient capacity during peak times.<br>Auto scaling helps optimize costs by matching provisioned capacity to actual demand patterns.<br>The other options are less optimal:<br>A. ElastiCache alone would add complexity and management overhead without the DynamoDB-specific optimizations that DAX provides.<br>B. Combining DAX and auto scaling with on-demand capacity mode would be more expensive than using provisioned capacity for this predictable workload. Savings Plans wouldn't offset this inefficiency.<br>C. Provisioned capacity mode with Savings Plans but without DAX wouldn't address the repeated lookups of a limited set of keys, missing a significant cost optimization opportunity.<br>Option D provides the most comprehensive cost optimization strategy by addressing all aspects of the company's usage pattern: caching for repeated reads, provisioned capacity for predictable workloads, and auto scaling for handling bursts efficiently.<br>Sources<br>Optimizing costs on DynamoDB tables - Amazon DynamoDB (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-cost-optimization.html)<br>In-memory acceleration with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) - Amazon DynamoDB （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAX.html）<br>Delhivery Case Study | AWS Cloud Financial Management （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/aws-cost-management/）<br>Use caching to reduce database demand - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/optimize-costs-microsoft-workloads/net-caching.html）<br>Is there a free tier for Dynamo DB On-Demand | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QULYTitlzWR3yD1fZ7OAjrtQ/is-there-a-free-tier-for-dynamo-db-on-demand）<br>Reduce latency and cost in read-heavy applications using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/reduce-latency-and-cost-in-read-heavy-applications-using-amazon-dynamodb-accelerator/）<br>How Samsung Cloud optimized Amazon DynamoDB costs | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/how-samsung-cloud-optimized-amazon-dynamodb-costs/）<br>

<br>The correct answer is A and C. <br>To resolve the issue of clients being unable to submit logs using the VPC endpoint, a solutions architect should take the following steps:<br><br><br>Ensure that the Network Load Balancer (NLB) is configured correctly:<br><br><br>The NLB should be in the same VPC as the EC2 instances running the logging service.<br>Verify that the NLB's target group includes the EC2 instances running the logging service.<br>Check that the health checks for the target group are passing.<br>Configure the VPC endpoint service to use the Network Load Balancer:<br><br><br>In the VPC console, go to "Endpoint Services" and create a new endpoint service.<br>Select the Network Load Balancer as the network load balancer for this endpoint service.<br>Make sure to add the AWS account IDs of the client accounts to the "Allowed principals" list.<br>These two steps are crucial because:<br><br><br>The NLB configuration ensures that the logging service is properly load-balanced and accessible.<br>Creating and configuring the VPC endpoint service to use the NLB establishes the necessary link between the PrivateLink interface endpoints in the client accounts and the logging service in the central account.<br>Additional considerations:<br><br><br>Ensure that the security groups associated with the EC2 instances allow incoming traffic from the NLB.<br>Verify that the NLB listener is configured to forward traffic to the correct port on the EC2 instances.<br>Check that the VPC endpoint service is in an "Available" state.<br>In the client accounts, ensure that the VPC endpoint is associated with the correct subnets and security groups.<br>By implementing these steps, you should resolve the connectivity issue and allow clients to submit logs using the VPC endpoint through AWS PrivateLink.<br>Why Not Other Options?<br>- Option B: Incorrect because NACLs should focus on NLB ↔ EC2 communication, not the interface endpoint (PrivateLink handles this).<br>- Option D: Incorrect because clients connect via the interface endpoint, not directly to EC2 instances. The NLB acts as the intermediary.<br>- Option E: Incorrect because the NLB’s security group should allow traffic from clients (via the interface endpoint), not just the endpoint subnets. However, NLBs don’t use security groups (they rely on NACLs).<br><br><br>https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/security-network-acl-vpc-endpoint <br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. To optimize costs with minimal operational overhead, the solutions architect can switch the encryption method from SSE-KMS to SSE-S3. This change reduces costs because SSE-S3 does not incur the per-request charges that AWS KMS does. Using S3 Batch Operations to copy the existing objects to a new bucket with SSE-S3 encryption requires minimal changes to the application and can be done without significant operational overhead.<br>The primary issue is the high AWS KMS costs due to frequent encryption/decryption requests for objects in the S3 bucket. The requirement is to reduce costs with minimal changes to the application. &nbsp;<br>- Option A (SSE-C) requires managing customer-provided keys, which introduces operational overhead (key management, rotation, etc.). This is not minimal effort. &nbsp;<br>- Option B (SSE-S3) replaces KMS encryption with S3-managed keys, which eliminates KMS request costs while maintaining server-side encryption. S3 Batch Operations automates the migration, minimizing manual effort. &nbsp;<br>- Option C (CloudHSM) is overly complex and expensive for this use case, requiring key management in a dedicated HSM. &nbsp;<br>- Option D (Intelligent-Tiering) does not address the KMS cost issue—it only optimizes storage costs. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Configure the EC2 instances to publish logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs by using the unified CloudWatch agent.<br>This solution will give the development team the ability to view application logs after a scale-in event for the following reasons:<br>Persistent Log Storage: When EC2 instances publish logs to CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch agent, the logs are stored in a centralized location that persists independently of the EC2 instances. This means that even after instances are terminated during scale-in events, the logs remain accessible.<br>Real-time Log Streaming: The CloudWatch agent streams logs to CloudWatch Logs in near real-time, ensuring that logs are captured before instances are terminated during scale-in events.<br>Application-specific Logs: Unlike ALB access logs which only capture HTTP request information, the CloudWatch agent can be configured to collect the actual application logs that contain detailed information about the application's behavior and performance, which is what the development team needs to improve the application.<br>Analysis Capabilities: CloudWatch Logs provides powerful querying and analysis tools through CloudWatch Logs Insights, allowing the development team to effectively analyze the logs to find ways to improve application performance.<br>The other options would not effectively solve the problem:<br>A.

Modify the Auto Scaling group to use a step scaling policy - This would only change how the Auto Scaling group scales, not how logs are preserved. The logs would still be lost when instances are terminated.<br>D. Instrument the application with AWS X-Ray tracing - While X-Ray provides valuable insights into application performance through distributed tracing, it's not primarily a log storage solution. It captures traces of requests through the application but doesn't preserve the detailed application logs needed for comprehensive analysis.<br>Configuring the CloudWatch agent to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs is the most appropriate solution as it directly addresses the need to preserve application logs after instances are terminated during scale-in events.<br>Sources<br>SEC04-BP01 Configure service and application logging - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2025-02-25/framework/sec_detect_investigate_events_app_service_logging.html）<br>SEC04-BP01 Configure service and application logging - AWS Well-Architected Framework (2022-03-31)（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2022-03-31/framework/sec_detect_investigate_events_app_service_logging.html） <br>SEC04-BP01 Configure service and application logging - AWS Well-Architected Framework (2023-04-10) （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-04-10/framework/sec_detect_investigate_events_app_service_logging.html）<br>Viewing logs from Amazon EC2 instances in your Elastic Beanstalk environment - AWS Elastic Beanstalk（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.logging.html） <br>EC2 Auto-Scaling Instances Retaining Old Data After Termination | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUJetklujSTha-jtw3BPWtiw/ec2-auto-scaling-instances-retaining-old-data-after-termination）<br>

<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>The correct answer is C. The CORS error is likely due to the API Gateway endpoint not being configured to allow the origin www.example.com. By enabling the CORS setting on the API Gateway, the architect can specify that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be set to www.example.com for all responses. This will allow the JavaScript code running on the static website to make successful requests to the API Gateway endpoint.The correct answer is C. Enable the CORS setting on the API Gateway API endpoint. Ensure that the API endpoint is configured to return all responses that have the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to www.example.com.<br> Explanation:<br>The CORS error occurs when a web application (hosted at `www.example.com`) makes a cross-origin request (to API Gateway) but the API endpoint does not explicitly allow requests from `www.example.com` by including the correct CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) in its response.<br>Here’s why the other options are incorrect:<br>- A: The S3 bucket's CORS configuration is irrelevant here because the error occurs when calling the API Gateway endpoint, not when accessing static content from S3.<br>- B: AWS WAF does not handle CORS headers. CORS is enforced at the application layer (API Gateway in this case), not the WAF layer.<br>- D: While the Lambda function could manually set CORS headers, the proper way to handle CORS for API Gateway is to enable CORS at the API Gateway level, which automatically adds the required headers to responses.<br> Correct Approach:<br>1. Enable CORS in API Gateway:<br> &nbsp; - Go to the API Gateway console, select the API, and enable CORS for the relevant endpoint.<br> &nbsp; - Specify `www.example.com` as an allowed origin.<br> &nbsp; - This ensures API Gateway includes the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: www.example.com` header in responses.<br>2. Redeploy the API:<br> &nbsp; - After enabling CORS, redeploy the API to apply the changes.<br>This will resolve the CORS error when the static website (`www.example.com`) makes requests to the API Gateway endpoint.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">ACE</span>
<br>The correct answers are A, C, and E. To centralize billing and management, a new AWS account can be created as a management account and an organization in AWS Organizations can be deployed (A). Identity federation can be achieved by deploying AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) and connecting it to the existing Azure Active Directory, allowing for the use of temporary credentials (C). Permission sets in AWS Single Sign-On can be created and attached to the appropriate groups and accounts to manage access (E). These steps will allow for centralized control over billing and user management while leveraging the company's existing Azure Active Directory for authentication.<br>1. A. Create a new AWS account to serve as a management account. Deploy an organization in AWS Organizations. Invite each existing AWS account to join the organization. Ensure that each account accepts the invitation. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This centralizes billing and management by setting up AWS Organizations, which allows consolidated billing and account management under a single "management account."<br>2. C. Deploy AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) in the management account. Connect IAM Identity Center to the Azure Active Directory. Configure IAM Identity Center for automatic synchronization of users and groups. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This enables identity federation by integrating AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO) with the existing Azure Active Directory, allowing users to log in using their corporate credentials. Automatic synchronization ensures users and groups stay up to date.<br>3. E. Create AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) permission sets. Attach the permission sets to the appropriate IAM Identity Center groups and AWS accounts. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Permission sets define access levels (like IAM policies) and can be assigned to users/groups from Azure AD, enabling temporary credentials (via AWS SSO) instead of long-lived access keys.<br> Why not the others?<br>- B. Changing email addresses for invoices is not necessary for centralizing billing (AWS Organizations already consolidates billing under the management account). This is not a required step.<br>- D. Deploying AWS Managed Microsoft AD is unnecessary because the company already has Azure AD, which can be federated directly via IAM Identity Center.<br>- F. Configuring IAM in each account to use AWS Managed Microsoft AD is redundant since IAM Identity Center already handles federation with Azure AD.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. Deploying Amazon ECS containers on Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling configured for memory utilization is a cost-effective solution because it allows the applications to share resources and only use what they need. This approach is more cost-efficient than deploying separate Lambda functions (Option A), which might be overprovisioned for infrequent use, or using Elastic Beanstalk (Option C), which could also lead to overprovisioning. Option D, deploying a new EC2 instance cluster, would likely be more expensive due to the need for potentially larger, reserved instances.<br>The company needs to manage 20 infrequently used but business-critical applications with varying memory requirements (up to 2.5 GB). The key requirements are: &nbsp;<br>- Cost efficiency (since applications are used sporadically). &nbsp;<br>- Standardized deployment methodology (all applications should follow the same approach). &nbsp;<br>- Handling long-running processes (e.g., the Java billing report that runs for hours). &nbsp;<br>- Scaling based on demand (month-end processing with occasional spikes). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is the Best Choice? &nbsp;<br>- Amazon ECS on EC2 with Auto Scaling allows running containers efficiently, scaling based on memory utilization (75% threshold ensures optimal resource usage). &nbsp;<br>- Task-level scaling ensures that only necessary resources are allocated per application. &nbsp;<br>- Cost-effective since EC2 instances can be stopped or scaled down when not in use, unlike always-on solutions like Option D. &nbsp;<br>- CloudWatch monitoring provides visibility into application performance and resource usage. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Less Suitable? &nbsp;<br>- A (Lambda): Lambda has a 15-minute execution limit, making it unsuitable for long-running jobs like the billing report. &nbsp;<br>- C (Elastic Beanstalk): Overkill for infrequently used apps; incurs higher baseline costs due to always-on resources. &nbsp;<br>- D (EC2 Reserved Instances): Not cost-effective for sporadic workloads; Reserved Instances require long-term commitment for underutilized apps. &nbsp;<br>Thus, Option B (Amazon ECS on EC2 with Auto Scaling) provides the best balance of cost efficiency, scalability, and standardization. &nbsp;<br>

<br>To minimize compute costs for the Amazon EMR cluster while meeting the business requirements, I recommend the following solution:<br>1. Use a combination of On-Demand and Spot Instances:<br> &nbsp; - Keep the primary node and core nodes as On-Demand Instances to ensure stability and data integrity.<br> &nbsp; - Convert task nodes to Spot Instances to reduce costs significantly.<br>2. Implement an instance fleet configuration:<br> &nbsp; - This allows you to specify a mix of instance types and purchasing options (On-Demand and Spot) for each node type.<br> &nbsp; - Set up multiple instance types for task nodes to increase the likelihood of obtaining Spot Instances.<br>3. Schedule cluster creation and termination:<br> &nbsp; - Create the cluster at 12:45 AM, just before the tasks start running at 1:00 AM.<br> &nbsp; - Terminate the cluster after the tasks complete (around 7:00 AM).<br> &nbsp; - Use AWS Step Functions or AWS Lambda with Amazon EventBridge to automate this process.<br>4. Optimize cluster size:<br> &nbsp; - Analyze the current workload and adjust the number of core and task nodes to match the processing requirements.<br> &nbsp; - Consider using larger instance types if it reduces the overall number of instances needed.<br>5. Utilize Amazon EMR managed scaling:<br> &nbsp; - Enable managed scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on workload.<br> &nbsp; - This ensures you have enough capacity during peak processing times and scales down when not needed.<br>6. Leverage EMR on Amazon EC2 Capacity Reservations:<br> &nbsp; - For the critical On-Demand Instances (primary and core nodes), consider using Capacity Reservations to ensure availability and potentially benefit from discounted pricing.<br>7. Use Amazon S3 for data storage:<br> &nbsp; - Store input and output data in Amazon S3 instead of HDFS to reduce the need for large, persistent core nodes.<br>8. Optimize EMR configurations:<br> &nbsp; - Fine-tune the EMR application settings to improve job efficiency and potentially reduce processing time.<br>9. Monitor and analyze cluster performance:<br> &nbsp; - Use Amazon CloudWatch and EMR built-in monitoring tools to identify optimization opportunities.<br>10. Consider using EMR Notebooks or EMR Studio:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- For any interactive analysis needs, use these services instead of keeping a cluster running continuously.<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Using only Spot Instances for all nodes (including primary/core) risks cluster instability if Spot interruptions occur. &nbsp;<br>- C: Keeping all nodes On-Demand is expensive, even with Savings Plans (Spot is cheaper for task nodes). &nbsp;<br>- D: Not terminating primary/core nodes after processing leads to unnecessary costs (they should be shut down when not in use). &nbsp;<br>By implementing these recommendations, you can significantly reduce compute costs while ensuring that the critical business tasks are completed reliably each day.

<br>The correct answer is C. By deploying a single NAT gateway with an Elastic IP address, the company can ensure that all outbound traffic from the EC2 instances appears to come from the whitelisted IP address, allowing communication with on-premises systems. Using Amazon CloudWatch with a custom metric to monitor the NAT gateway and invoking an AWS Lambda function to create a new NAT gateway in a different subnet if the current one becomes unhealthy provides a way to automatically mitigate failures.<br>Requirements:<br>1. Communication with On-Premises Systems: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The application (running on EC2 instances in private subnets) needs to communicate with on-premises systems.<br> &nbsp; - The on-premises firewall only allows traffic from a single allowed IP address (the Elastic IP address).<br>2. High Availability & Automatic Failure Mitigation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The solution must handle failures automatically without manual intervention.<br> &nbsp; - Since only one Elastic IP is available, it must be reassigned dynamically if a failure occurs.<br> Why Option C is Correct:<br>- NAT Gateway with Elastic IP: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- A NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to communicate with on-premises systems while using the Elastic IP as the source IP.<br> &nbsp;- Only one NAT Gateway is needed since only one Elastic IP is available.<br> &nbsp;- NAT Gateway is highly available within a single Availability Zone (AZ) but not across AZs.<br>- Failure Mitigation with CloudWatch & Lambda: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- CloudWatch can monitor the NAT Gateway’s health (e.g., via custom metrics like connection failures).<br> &nbsp;- If the NAT Gateway fails, a Lambda function can:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Create a new NAT Gateway in a different subnet (different AZ).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Reassign the Elastic IP to the new NAT Gateway.<br> &nbsp;- This ensures automatic failover without manual intervention.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- Option A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Deploying three NAT Gateways (one per AZ) is unnecessary because only one Elastic IP is available.<br> &nbsp;- NAT Gateway health checks are not natively supported by AWS, and manual recreation is not scalable.<br>- Option B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Replacing the ALB with an NLB does not solve the outbound communication problem (NLB is for inbound traffic).<br> &nbsp;- NLBs do not provide NAT functionality for private instances.<br>- Option D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Assigning the Elastic IP to the ALB is irrelevant because the ALB handles inbound traffic, not outbound traffic to on-premises systems.<br> &nbsp;- Route 53 health checks cannot fix NAT Gateway failures.<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option C is the best solution because it uses a NAT Gateway for outbound traffic, assigns the Elastic IP, and implements automated failover using CloudWatch and Lambda.<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">BEF</span>
<br>The correct combination of steps is BEF. First, the management account of the current organization should remove each developer account using the RemoveAccountFromOrganization operation (B). Then, the new developer organization's management account should send an invitation to each developer account using the InviteAccountToOrganization operation (E). Finally, each developer must sign in to their account and accept the invitation to officially join the new organization (F).<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>B. From the management account, remove each developer account from the old organization using the RemoveAccountFromOrganization operation in the Organizations API.<br>E. Call the InviteAccountToOrganization operation in the Organizations API from the new developer organization's management account to send invitations to the developer accounts.<br>F. Have each developer sign in to their account and confirm to join the new developer organization.<br>These three steps represent the correct process for moving AWS accounts from one organization to another:<br>First, you must remove the accounts from their current organization. This is done from the management account of the old organization using the RemoveAccountFromOrganization API operation (option B). This step is necessary because an AWS account can only be a member of one organization at a time.<br>Next, the management account of the new developer organization needs to invite the standalone accounts to join. This is done by calling the InviteAccountToOrganization API operation (option E). This sends formal invitations to each of the developer accounts.<br>Finally, each invitation must be accepted. Since the accounts are now standalone (as mentioned in the scenario: "All accounts are set up with all the required information so that each account can be operated as a standalone account"), the account owners need to sign in to their respective accounts and accept the invitation to join the new organization (option F).<br>This three-step process (remove from old organization, invite to new organization, accept invitation) is the standard procedure for moving AWS accounts between organizations. The scenario specifically mentions that there are 540 developer accounts to move, so this process would need to be repeated or automated for each account.<br>The other options that weren't selected likely contained incorrect steps or operations that don't align with the proper AWS Organizations account migration process.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use an S3 event notification that invokes an AWS Lambda function.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Timing of Detection: S3 event notifications trigger immediately when new objects are uploaded to the bucket. This means the corruption detection logic will run as soon as images are ingested, before they are served to users through CloudFront. This provides the minimal latency between ingestion and serving that the requirements specify.<br>Prevention Rather Than Detection: By running the detection logic at ingestion time, corrupted images can be identified and handled before they ever reach the CloudFront distribution. This is more efficient than detecting corruption after the images have already been requested by users.<br>Seamless Integration with Python Logic: The company has already implemented and tested Python logic to detect corrupt images. AWS Lambda natively supports Python, making it straightforward to integrate the existing detection code without significant modifications.<br>Asynchronous Processing: The Lambda function triggered by the S3 event notification can process the image in the background without blocking the ingestion process, maintaining system performance.<br>Scalability: This solution automatically scales to handle varying volumes of image uploads without manual intervention.<br>The other options have significant drawbacks:<br>A. Lambda@Edge with viewer-response event - This would detect corruption too late, as it runs after CloudFront has already retrieved the image and is about to send it to the viewer. This adds unnecessary latency and doesn't prevent corrupted images from being served.<br>B. Lambda@Edge with origin-response event - Similar to option A, this detects corruption too late in the process, after the image has been retrieved from S3 but before CloudFront caches it. This still doesn't prevent the initial serving of corrupted images.<br>D. S3 event notification with Step Functions - While this would work similarly to option C, it adds unnecessary complexity for this use case. Step Functions are beneficial for orchestrating complex workflows with multiple steps, but the scenario only mentions a single Python-based detection logic, making Lambda alone sufficient and more efficient.<br>Option C provides the optimal balance of minimal latency and effective implementation of the corruption detection logic by processing images immediately upon upload, before they are served to users through CloudFront.<br>Sources<br>How Lambda@Edge works with requests and responses - Amazon CloudFront （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-event-request-response.html）<br>create_distribution - Boto3 1.38.12 documentation （https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/cloudfront/client/create_distribution.html）<br>Work with requests and responses - Amazon CloudFront（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-generating-http-responses.html） <br>AWS services in this solution - Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront (Formerly known as Serverless Image Handler) （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/serverless-image-handler/aws-services-in-this-solution.html）<br>Process Objects on Amazon S3 with Precision File Type Detection | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/articles/ARDCY-_jnOTbS_OOk8F4kLVA/process-objects-on-amazon-s3-with-precision-file-type-detection）<br>

<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>The correct answer is D. By creating a new AMI with the CodeDeploy agent pre-installed and configuring the Auto Scaling group to use this AMI, new instances launched by the Auto Scaling group will automatically have the necessary agent. Associating the CodeDeploy deployment group with the Auto Scaling group ensures that new instances are automatically included in the deployment process, reducing the operational overhead as it eliminates the need for manual installation of the agent or manual association with the deployment group.<br>1. Least Operational Overhead: <br> &nbsp; - By creating an AMI with the CodeDeploy agent pre-installed and configuring the Auto Scaling group's launch template to use this AMI, you ensure that every new EC2 instance launched by Auto Scaling will automatically have the CodeDeploy agent ready.<br> &nbsp; - Associating the CodeDeploy deployment group with the Auto Scaling group (instead of individual instances) ensures that any new instances launched will automatically be part of the deployment group without manual intervention.<br>2. Fully Automated:<br> &nbsp; - No need for additional Lambda functions (Option A) or manual suspension of scaling operations (Option B).<br> &nbsp; - No dependency on CodeBuild (Option C) to rebuild AMIs and trigger refreshes—this approach is simpler and more direct.<br>3. AWS Best Practice:<br> &nbsp; - Using launch templates with pre-configured AMIs is a recommended way to ensure consistency in Auto Scaling deployments.<br> &nbsp; - CodeDeploy natively supports Auto Scaling group integrations, eliminating the need to manage instances individually.<br> Why Not Other Options?<br>- Option A: While it works, it introduces unnecessary complexity with EventBridge and Lambda when CodeDeploy already supports Auto Scaling group integration.<br>- Option B: Suspending Auto Scaling operations is disruptive and not scalable for frequent deployments.<br>- Option C: While feasible, it requires additional steps (CodeBuild, AMI updates, instance refresh) when a simpler solution exists.<br> Conclusion<br>Option D provides the most automated and least operationally heavy solution by leveraging native AWS integrations (AMI + Auto Scaling group association with CodeDeploy). &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. By creating an Auto Scaling group and attaching it to the existing ALB, the architect can ensure that new instances are automatically registered with the load balancer. Attaching the existing EC2 instances to the new Auto Scaling group allows for management of all instances, both new and old, through the same scaling policy. This approach minimizes downtime and operational overhead as it does not require the deletion of the existing ALB or the creation of a new one.<br> Requirements:<br>1. Highly available solution that automatically replaces EC2 instances.<br>2. Minimize downtime during the switch to the new solution.<br> Analysis of Options:<br>- Option A: Deleting the existing ALB first would cause downtime. Also, manually attaching existing EC2 instances to an Auto Scaling group is not a best practice.<br>- Option B: This is the correct approach because:<br> &nbsp;- It keeps the existing ALB, avoiding downtime.<br> &nbsp;- It creates an Auto Scaling group with a launch template (ensuring new instances match the desired configuration).<br> &nbsp;- It attaches the Auto Scaling group to the existing ALB, maintaining traffic flow.<br> &nbsp;- It registers existing EC2 instances with the Auto Scaling group, allowing Auto Scaling to manage them.<br> &nbsp;- This method ensures no downtime and provides automatic instance recovery.<br>- Option C: Deleting the existing ALB and EC2 instances first would cause significant downtime.<br>- Option D: The ALB does not "register instances with the Auto Scaling group"—this is misleading. Instances must be explicitly attached to the Auto Scaling group.<br> Why Option B is Best:<br>- No downtime: The existing ALB and instances remain operational.<br>- Auto Scaling integration: The Auto Scaling group takes over instance management, automatically replacing unhealthy instances.<br>- Seamless transition: Existing instances are registered with the Auto Scaling group, ensuring continuity.<br> Final Answer:<br>B. Create an Auto Scaling group that is configured to handle the web application traffic. Attach a new launch template to the Auto Scaling group. Attach the Auto Scaling group to the existing ALB.

<br>The correct answer is C. By creating an AWS Service Catalog portfolio with approved VPC configurations and S3 gateway endpoints, the company can provide developers with a simple method to deploy resources that adhere to the architectural patterns. This approach automates the enforcement of best practices and reduces the operational overhead for developers. Additionally, by configuring launch constraints and scoping IAM permissions, the company ensures that developers only use approved resources, which can help to control costs.<br> Why Option C is the Best Choice? &nbsp;<br>1. Proactive Enforcement of Approved Architecture: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS Service Catalog allows the company to predefine approved VPC configurations (with S3 gateway endpoints) and approved EC2 instance types, ensuring developers deploy only compliant resources. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This prevents excessive data-transfer costs (by enforcing S3 gateway endpoints instead of NAT gateways) and unnecessary compute costs (by restricting EC2 instance types). &nbsp;<br>2. No Negative Impact on Developer Speed: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Developers can still quickly deploy resources using pre-approved templates, without waiting for manual reviews or remediation. &nbsp;<br>3. IAM Permissions Restriction: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - By scoping developers' IAM permissions to only AWS Service Catalog, they cannot bypass the approved configurations. &nbsp;<br>4. Cost Optimization: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 gateway endpoints eliminate NAT gateway charges for S3 traffic. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Approved EC2 instance types prevent over-provisioning, reducing compute costs. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- Option A: SCPs can block unapproved instances, but they don’t automate deployment of compliant VPCs/S3 endpoints. Relying solely on CloudFormation templates still allows manual misconfigurations. &nbsp;<br>- Option B: Reactive budgeting doesn’t enforce architecture and terminating resources disrupts developers. &nbsp;<br>- Option D: AWS Config is reactive (detects & remediates after deployment), leading to potential cost spikes before fixes. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option C (AWS Service Catalog) is the most proactive, cost-effective, and developer-friendly solution. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Launch an AWS Control Tower landing zone. Create OUs and attach SCPs that deny access to run services outside of the approved Regions.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Scalability: The scenario involves "hundreds of different AWS accounts in multiple AWS Regions." AWS Control Tower is specifically designed to manage multi-account environments at scale. It provides a streamlined way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on best practices.<br>Centralized Policy Management: Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations (which is part of Control Tower) allow for centralized policy management across all accounts. This makes it much more efficient to implement and maintain region restrictions across hundreds of accounts.<br>Preventive Controls: SCPs act as guardrails that cannot be overridden by account administrators. They provide a true preventive control that denies access to operations outside of designated regions, regardless of the permissions granted within individual accounts.<br>Hierarchical Structure: Organizational Units (OUs) in Control Tower allow for grouping accounts logically, making it possible to apply different region restrictions to different groups of accounts if needed.<br>Inheritance: Policies applied at the OU level are automatically inherited by all accounts within that OU, ensuring consistent enforcement without having to configure each account individually.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. Creating IAM roles with conditional allow permissions for each account would be extremely difficult to manage across hundreds of accounts. It would be prone to inconsistencies and human error.<br>B. Creating IAM users for each account and attaching policies to block access would be even more unmanageable than option A, as it would require maintaining individual users across hundreds of accounts. Additionally, IAM best practices recommend using roles rather than users for cross-account access.<br>D. AWS Security Hub is primarily a security monitoring and compliance service. While it can detect non-compliant resources, it doesn't provide preventive controls to deny access to operations. It would identify violations after they occur rather than preventing them.<br>AWS Control Tower with SCPs provides the most comprehensive, scalable, and manageable solution for enforcing region restrictions across hundreds of AWS accounts.<br>Sources<br>Defining Boundaries for Regional Services Access - Navigating GDPR Compliance on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/navigating-gdpr-compliance/defining-boundaries-for-regional-services-access.html）<br>Using AWS Organizations for security - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/organizations-security.html）<br>AWS account management and separation - Security Pillar（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/aws-account-management-and-separation.html） <br>Protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access using AWS Organizations integrations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/protect-your-aws-resources-from-unauthorized-access-using-aws-organizations-integrations/）<br>Enforcing enterprise-wide preventive controls with AWS Organizations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/enforcing-enterprise-wide-preventive-controls-with-aws-organizations/）<br>Effectively implementing resource controls policies in a multi-account environment | AWS Security Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/security/effectively-implementing-resource-controls-policies-in-a-multi-account-environment/）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use Amazon S3 for web hosting with AWS AppSync for database API services. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) for order queuing. Use AWS Lambda for business logic with an Amazon SQS dead-letter queue for retaining failed orders.<br>This solution will meet the company's requirements for the following reasons:<br>Decoupled Architecture:<br>S3 for web hosting separates the frontend from the backend services<br>AppSync provides a managed GraphQL API layer that decouples the database interactions<br>SQS creates a buffer between order submission and processing<br>Lambda functions handle business logic independently from other components<br>This complete separation of concerns creates a truly decoupled system<br>Scalability:<br>All components (S3, AppSync, SQS, Lambda) are fully managed serverless services that scale automatically<br>S3 can handle virtually unlimited web traffic<br>SQS can scale to handle high volumes of orders during peak periods<br>Lambda functions automatically scale to process orders based on queue depth<br>This architecture eliminates the need to manage scaling for any component<br>Mechanism for Retaining Failed Orders:<br>SQS dead-letter queues provide a built-in mechanism to capture and retain failed orders<br>Failed orders can be easily monitored, analyzed, and reprocessed when issues are resolved<br>The retention period can be configured based on business needs<br>Minimizing Operational Costs:<br>All components follow a pay-for-what-you-use pricing model<br>No need to pay for idle resources during low-traffic periods<br>No server management or patching required<br>Reduced operational overhead for monitoring and maintaining infrastructure<br>SQS dead-letter queues are more cost-effective than Glacier Deep Archive for the use case of retaining failed orders that need to be accessible<br>Option B (Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway, Amazon MQ, Step Functions, S3 Glacier Deep Archive) has several disadvantages:<br>Elastic Beanstalk still requires managing EC2 instances, which increases operational costs<br>Amazon MQ is more complex and expensive to operate than SQS for simple order queuing<br>S3 Glacier Deep Archive has extremely long retrieval times (12+ hours), making it impractical for retaining failed orders that may need to be reprocessed quickly<br>This solution has higher fixed costs regardless of usage levels<br>The serverless architecture in Option C provides the optimal balance of decoupling, scalability, effective handling of failed orders, and minimal operational costs, making it the best solution for the company's requirements.<br>Sources<br>Architecture details - Enhanced Document Understanding on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/enhanced-document-understanding-on-aws/architecture-details.html）<br>Connect to Amazon EventBridge to send and receive events - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation （https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/data/custom-business-logic/connect-eventbridge-datasource/）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora global database with the primary in us-east-1 and the secondary in us-west-2.<br>This solution will meet the required RTO of less than 5 minutes and RPO of less than 1 minute for the following reasons:<br>Recovery Point Objective (RPO) &lt; 1 minute:<br>Amazon Aurora Global Database uses a purpose-built replication technology that typically maintains replication lag of less than 1 second between the primary and secondary regions.<br>This ensures that in the event of a disaster, data loss would be minimal (measured in seconds), well within the RPO requirement of less than 1 minute.<br>The storage-based replication used by Aurora Global Database is more efficient than the binary log replication used by standard MySQL, resulting in lower replication lag.<br>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) &lt; 5 minutes:<br>Aurora Global Database allows for managed failover to the secondary region, which can be completed in less than 1 minute.<br>When combined with the already configured Route 53 health checks and DNS failover to us-west-2, the entire application stack can be failed over within the 5-minute RTO requirement.<br>The secondary region database is already warm and ready to accept write operations immediately after promotion.<br>Option A (Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance with a cross-Region read replica) would not meet the requirements because:<br>RDS for MySQL cross-region read replicas use asynchronous replication based on binary logs, which can introduce higher replication lag that might exceed the RPO requirement of less than 1 minute, especially during periods of high write activity.<br>The failover process for RDS MySQL read replicas is manual and involves several steps:<br>Promoting the read replica to a standalone instance<br>Updating application connection strings<br>Waiting for DNS propagation<br>This manual process would likely exceed the RTO requirement of less than 5 minutes.<br>Amazon Aurora Global Database is specifically designed for cross-region disaster recovery scenarios with stringent RTO and RPO requirements.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Associate the specific member accounts with a new OU. Apply a tag policy and an SCP using conditions to limit Regions.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Centralized Management: By creating a dedicated Organizational Unit (OU) for the specific member accounts that need region restrictions, you can centrally manage policies from the AWS Organizations management console. This provides a single point of control for both region restrictions and tagging requirements.<br>Minimal Configuration: Using OUs with Service Control Policies (SCPs) and tag policies is more efficient than configuring individual accounts. You only need to set up the policies once at the OU level, and they automatically apply to all accounts within that OU. When new accounts need the same restrictions, you simply move them into the OU.<br>Region Restriction: SCPs are preventive guardrails that can deny access to AWS services in specific regions. By using conditions in the SCP, you can precisely control which regions are allowed or denied for the accounts in the OU. This is a preventive control that blocks non-compliant actions before they occur.<br>Tag Enforcement: Tag policies in AWS Organizations allow you to define tagging rules and enforce them across multiple accounts. When applied at the OU level, these policies ensure consistent tagging across all resources in the member accounts, meeting the regulatory requirement for standardized tagging.<br>Flexibility: This approach allows for different policies to be applied to different groups of accounts by organizing them into appropriate OUs, which is ideal for environments with varying regulatory requirements.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. Creating AWS Config rules in specific member accounts would be detective rather than preventive, meaning non-compliant resources could still be created and would only be flagged after the fact. This approach also requires configuration in each account, which doesn't meet the "centrally managed with minimal configuration" requirement.<br>B. Disabling regions from the Billing console is not a comprehensive solution for restricting resource deployment. It primarily affects the console experience but doesn't prevent API or CLI access to those regions. Additionally, this approach doesn't provide robust tag enforcement capabilities.<br>C. Applying policies at the root level would affect all accounts in the organization, which may be too broad if only specific member accounts need these restrictions. This doesn't allow for the targeted application of policies that the scenario requires.<br>Option D provides the most effective, centralized, and least-effort approach to meeting the regulatory requirements for both region restrictions and tag enforcement on specific member accounts.<br>Sources<br>Tag Policies vs required-tags rule | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUJVliDkVfQ6iJD0aUy0EU2A/tag-policies-vs-required-tags-rule）<br>AWS account management and separation - Security Pillar (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/aws-account-management-and-separation.html)<br>Defining Boundaries for Regional Services Access - Navigating GDPR Compliance on AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/navigating-gdpr-compliance/defining-boundaries-for-regional-services-access.html)<br>Delegated Administrators Guide to Effective Controls in AWS Organizations | AWS Cloud Operations Blog (https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/mt/delegated-administrators-guide-to-effective-controls-in-aws-organizations/)<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Use the Block Public Access feature in Amazon S3 to set the IgnorePublicAcls option to TRUE on the bucket.<br>This solution will immediately remediate the security issue without impacting the application's normal workflow for the following reasons:<br>Immediate Effect: The Block Public Access feature takes effect immediately when enabled, instantly blocking any public access to the bucket and its objects regardless of existing permissions.<br>Preserves Signed URL Functionality: Setting IgnorePublicAcls to TRUE specifically targets and blocks public access through ACLs, but it doesn't interfere with pre-signed URL functionality. Pre-signed URLs work through temporary credentials and don't rely on public ACLs, so the application can continue generating signed URLs for authenticated users to download their reports.<br>Non-Disruptive: This approach doesn't require modifying individual objects or changing the application's code. It works at the bucket level to override any public permissions without altering the underlying objects or their ACLs.<br>Comprehensive Protection: The IgnorePublicAcls setting ensures that even if objects in the bucket have public ACLs applied to them (which is likely the cause of the current issue), those ACLs will be ignored, effectively making the objects private.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>B. Reviewing the AWS Trusted Advisor bucket permissions check is only an advisory step that identifies potential issues but doesn't actually implement any changes to remediate the problem. This would not immediately fix the security issue.<br>C.

<br>The correct combination of steps is ACE. First, the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) can be used to create a new RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance with the schema and initial data from the source Oracle database (A and B). Next, AWS DMS can be used to perform a full load of the data followed by change data capture (CDC) to replicate ongoing changes during the migration (E). Finally, once the migration is complete, the CNAME record in Route 53 can be updated to point to the new PostgreSQL DB instance endpoint, ensuring no downtime (E). Configuring VPC peering (C) is necessary to enable connectivity between the source and target environments, facilitating the migration process.<br>1. A. Create a new RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance in the target account. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database schema from the source database to the target database. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS SCT is used to convert the Oracle schema to PostgreSQL schema, including stored procedures, functions, and other database objects. This is necessary because Oracle and PostgreSQL have different syntax and features. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The initial data load is not handled by SCT; that is done by AWS DMS.<br>2. C. Configure VPC peering between the VPCs in the two AWS accounts to provide connectivity to both DB instances from the target account. Configure the security groups to allow traffic on the database port from the VPC in the target account. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Since both databases are in private subnets, VPC peering is required to establish connectivity between them securely. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Security groups must be configured to allow traffic between the source and target databases.<br>3. E. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) in the target account to perform a full load plus change data capture (CDC) migration from the source database to the target database. When the migration is complete, change the CNAME record to point to the target DB instance endpoint. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS DMS performs the full load (initial data migration) and CDC (ongoing replication of changes during migration). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Once the databases are in sync, the Route 53 CNAME is updated to point to the new PostgreSQL database, completing the cutover with minimal downtime.<br> Why not the other options?<br>- B: AWS SCT does not create a new RDS instance or migrate data; it only converts the schema.<br>- D: Making the source database publicly accessible is not secure and violates the requirement of keeping it in a private subnet.<br>- F: CDC alone is insufficient; a full load + CDC is required to migrate all existing data and replicate changes.<br>Thus, the correct answers are A, C, and E.<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Configure a new SQS standard queue as a dead-letter queue to isolate the faulty messages.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Continued Processing of Subsequent Messages:<br>By implementing a dead-letter queue (DLQ), the system can move the problematic message out of the main processing queue after a defined number of failed processing attempts.<br>Once the faulty message is moved to the DLQ, the system will automatically continue processing the next messages in the queue, preventing the blockage that's currently occurring.<br>This ensures business continuity while still preserving the problematic message for analysis.<br>Analysis of Faulty Messages:<br>The dead-letter queue preserves the faulty messages in a separate queue where they can be examined without affecting the main processing flow.<br>This allows the solutions architect to analyze the problematic order message in detail to understand what's causing the error.<br>The original message content and metadata are maintained, providing valuable diagnostic information.<br>Proper Error Handling:<br>Using a DLQ is a standard pattern for handling poison messages (messages that cannot be processed successfully) in event-driven architectures.<br>It provides a systematic way to deal with errors rather than letting them repeatedly block the system.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. Increasing the backend processing timeout to 30 seconds would not solve the problem. If the message is causing an error, giving it more processing time won't help - it will still fail and continue to block subsequent messages.<br>B. Reducing the visibility timeout would not automatically remove the faulty message. It would only make the message visible again sooner, causing it to be picked up for processing again, likely resulting in the same error. This could create an infinite loop of failed processing attempts.<br>Option D provides the most effective solution by isolating the problematic message while allowing the system to continue processing other orders. It also preserves the faulty message for analysis, which is crucial for identifying and fixing the underlying issue.<br>Sources<br>Amazon SQS error handling and problematic messages - Amazon Simple Queue Service (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/best-practices-error-handling.html)<br>Using dead-letter queues in Amazon SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html)<br>Amazon SQS best practices - Amazon Simple Queue Service (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-best-practices.html)<br>Regarding SQS dead-letter queue (DLQ) | AWS re:Post (https://repost.aws/questions/QU6S7Kzhe4T3yWAQbyuHufow/regarding-sqs-dead-letter-queue-dlq)<br>Infinite retries due to exceeded SQS visibility timeout | AWS re:Post(https://repost.aws/questions/QUOGzGulGSS1-wtgDIj22USw/infinite-retries-due-to-exceeded-sqs-visibility-timeout) <br>Capturing problematic messages in Amazon SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/capturing-problematic-messages.html)<br>

<br>Question #277<br>A company has automated the nightly retraining of its machine learning models by using AWS Step Functions. The workflow consists of multiple steps that use AWS Lambda. Each step can fail for various reasons, and any failure causes a failure of the overall workflow. A review reveals that the retraining has failed multiple nights in a row without the company noticing the failure.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">ABC</span>
<br>The correct combination of steps is ABC. To ensure that the team is notified of any failures in the retraining process, the architect should create an SNS topic and subscribe the team's email to it (A). Then, a task named "Email" should be created within the Step Functions workflow to publish messages to the SNS topic when a failure occurs (B). To catch all types of failures, a Catch block should be added to all states with a condition that listens for any error ("States.ALL") and then transitions to the "Email" task (C). This setup will capture any failure, regardless of its type, and trigger the notification process.<br> <br>

<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. By enabling DNS hostnames for the VPC and configuring a new outbound endpoint with Amazon Route 53 Resolver, the architect can create a Resolver rule that forwards DNS queries for the company.example domain to the on-premises DNS server. This setup allows the EC2 instances within the VPC to resolve the hostnames of the on-premises services, thus integrating with the existing services.<br>The requirement is for the EC2 instances in the VPC to resolve hostnames in the company.example domain, which is hosted on-premises. Since the DNS zone is only available on the company's private network, we need to forward DNS queries for company.example to the on-premises DNS servers. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct: &nbsp;<br>1. Turn on DNS hostnames for the VPC – Ensures that instances in the VPC can resolve DNS hostnames. &nbsp;<br>2. Configure an outbound endpoint with Route 53 Resolver – Allows the VPC to send DNS queries to external (on-premises) DNS servers. &nbsp;<br>3. Create a Resolver rule to forward requests for company.example to on-premises name servers – This ensures that any DNS queries for company.example are forwarded to the on-premises DNS servers, while all other queries go to the default AWS resolver. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect: &nbsp;<br>- A: Creating an empty private zone in Route 53 and modifying the on-premises DNS to point to it would break resolution since the zone is hosted on-premises. &nbsp;<br>- C: Configuring an inbound resolver would allow on-premises systems to query AWS DNS, but we need the opposite (VPC to query on-premises DNS). &nbsp;<br>- D: Using a hosts file is not scalable and would require manual updates whenever hostnames change. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the correct solution because it forwards DNS queries for company.example to the on-premises DNS servers while allowing all other queries to resolve normally. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>The correct answer is C. To restrict traffic between VPCs and ensure that each VPC can only communicate with a specific set of authorized VPCs, the solutions architect should create a dedicated transit gateway route table for each VPC attachment. By doing so, the architect can define explicit routes within these dedicated route tables to only allow traffic to the authorized VPCs. This approach provides granular control over the routing of traffic between VPCs and ensures that the communication is limited as per the security requirements.<br>The issue is that all VPCs are attached to the transit gateway and using its default route table, which allows unrestricted communication between all attached VPCs. To restrict traffic between VPCs while still allowing communication only with predefined authorized VPCs, the best approach is to:<br>1. Create dedicated transit gateway route tables for each VPC attachment instead of using the default route table.<br>2. Configure explicit routes in each transit gateway route table to allow traffic only to the authorized VPCs.<br>This ensures that VPCs can communicate only with the explicitly allowed VPCs while still maintaining the shared internet egress through the shared services VPC.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A. Network ACLs are stateless and apply broadly to subnets, making them inefficient for fine-grained VPC-to-VPC control. They also don’t scale well for dynamic environments.<br>- B. Security Groups are instance-level controls and would require manual updates for every instance, which is impractical.<br>- D. Updating VPC route tables alone won’t restrict traffic at the transit gateway level, as the transit gateway’s default route table still allows all VPCs to communicate.<br> Key Takeaway:<br>Transit Gateway route tables provide the most scalable and centralized way to control inter-VPC routing while maintaining the required connectivity. <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Store data in Amazon S3. Use the AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon Athena to query data.<br>This solution will be the most cost-effective for the given scenario for the following reasons:<br>Serverless Architecture: Amazon Athena is a serverless query service, meaning you don't pay for any idle resources. Since the queries only run between 5 PM and 10 PM, a serverless solution eliminates the cost of maintaining infrastructure during the 19 hours per day when no queries are running.<br>Pay-Per-Query Pricing: With Athena, you only pay for the data scanned during query execution. This is ideal for the intermittent query pattern described (only 5 hours per day), as you're not paying for unused capacity.<br>Optimized for ORC Files: Athena works efficiently with columnar file formats like ORC (which the company is already using). ORC files in S3 can be queried directly by Athena, providing good performance while minimizing the amount of data scanned, which further reduces costs.<br>AWS Glue Data Catalog Integration: The AWS Glue Data Catalog provides a persistent metadata store that makes the data easily discoverable and queryable without requiring constant cluster resources.<br>SQL Interface: Athena provides a standard SQL interface, which meets the requirement for SQL data queries and would be familiar to users currently using Presto.<br>The other options have significant cost disadvantages:<br>A. Amazon Redshift Spectrum with data in S3 would require maintaining a Redshift cluster even during the 19 hours per day when no queries are running, which would be less cost-effective than the serverless Athena approach.<br>D. Storing data in Amazon Redshift would be the most expensive option because:<br>It would require provisioning Redshift cluster capacity to handle the large data volumes<br>The cluster would be idle for 19 hours per day<br>There would be additional costs for loading data from IoT devices into Redshift<br>Redshift is optimized for complex analytical queries rather than simple queries that run for less than 15 minutes<br>The combination of S3 storage (which is very cost-effective for large data volumes) and Athena's serverless query capability provides the most economical solution for the described workload pattern, while still meeting the requirement for SQL-based data analysis.<br>Sources<br>Amazon Redshift Spectrum overview - Amazon Redshift (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-spectrum-overview.html)<br>When should I use Athena? - Amazon Athena (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/when-should-i-use-ate.html)<br>In-place querying - Storage Best Practices for Data and Analytics Applications (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-data-lakes/in-place-querying.html)<br>Querying your data lake - Amazon Redshift (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/data-lake.html)<br>Architecture patterns to optimize Amazon Redshift performance at scale | AWS Big Data Blog(https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/architecture-patterns-to-optimize-amazon-redshift-performance-at-scale/) <br>Amazon Redshift deep dive - Data Warehousing on AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-warehousing-on-aws/amazon-redshift-deep-dive.html)<br>Accelerate Amazon Redshift Data Lake queries with AWS Glue Data Catalog Column Statistics | AWS Big Data Blog (https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/accelerate-amazon-redshift-data-lake-queries-with-column-level-statistics/)<br><br><br>

<br>The correct answer is C. The solutions architect should use the Tag Editor to apply tags to existing resources, ensuring that cost allocation tags for the cost center and project ID are in place. Additionally, creating SCPs (Service Control Policies) within AWS Organizations can enforce tagging requirements for all resources created moving forward, ensuring that new DynamoDB tables and RDS instances cannot be provisioned without the necessary tags. This approach not only addresses the immediate need to tag existing resources but also prevents future un-tagged resources from being created.<br> Requirements Summary:<br>1. Increase visibility into AWS Billing and Cost Management (requires proper tagging).<br>2. No consistent tagging strategy, but CloudFormation mandates consistent tagging for new deployments.<br>3. Management requires cost center and project ID tags for all existing and future RDS and DynamoDB resources.<br>4. Multiple accounts under AWS Organizations (centralized control needed).<br> Analysis of Options:<br> Option A:<br>- Tag Editor can manually tag existing resources (partially meets the requirement).<br>- Cost allocation tags help in billing visibility.<br>- But: Waiting 24 hours for tag propagation doesn’t enforce future compliance. No mechanism prevents untagged resource creation.<br> Option B:<br>- AWS Config rule can detect untagged resources (reactive, not proactive).<br>- Lambda-based tagging solution (complex, requires maintenance, and may lag in real-time enforcement).<br>- Does not prevent untagged resource creation, only reacts afterward.<br> Option C:<br>- Tag Editor ensures existing resources are tagged.<br>- Cost allocation tags enable billing visibility.<br>- SCPs (Service Control Policies) enforce compliance proactively by blocking resource creation without required tags.<br>- CloudFormation ensures new deployments comply with tagging guidelines.<br>- Best meets all requirements: Existing tagging, billing visibility, and future enforcement.<br> Option D:<br>- Cost allocation tags help with billing.<br>- Federated role updates restrict untagged resource creation, but this is less scalable and harder to manage than SCPs.<br>- No mention of tagging existing resources (only propagation, which doesn’t guarantee coverage).<br> Why Option C is Best:<br>- Proactive enforcement via SCPs (blocks non-compliant resource creation).<br>- Tag Editor covers existing resources.<br>- CloudFormation ensures future deployments comply (since SCPs enforce tagging).<br>- Cost allocation tags provide billing visibility.<br> Conclusion:<br>Option C is the most comprehensive and scalable solution, addressing both existing and future tagging requirements while enforcing compliance via SCPs.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Enable DynamoDB auto scaling for the table.<br>This solution will meet the requirements most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>Predictable Traffic Pattern: The restaurant has a predictable model with high sales traffic for 4 hours daily and lower traffic outside those peak hours. This is an ideal scenario for DynamoDB auto scaling, which can automatically adjust capacity based on actual usage patterns.<br>Cost Optimization: With auto scaling, the provisioned capacity will automatically scale up during the 4-hour peak periods and scale down during the remaining 20 hours of lower traffic. This means you'll only pay for the capacity you actually need at any given time, rather than constantly paying for peak capacity (100,000 RCUs and 80,000 WCUs) throughout the entire day.<br>Minimal Operational Overhead: Once configured, auto scaling requires minimal intervention from the IT staff. The system will automatically adjust capacity based on defined utilization targets, eliminating the need for manual capacity adjustments throughout the day.<br>Balance of Performance and Cost: Auto scaling ensures that the application maintains performance during peak hours while optimizing costs during off-peak hours.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. Reducing the provisioned RCUs and WCUs would lower costs but could lead to throttling during peak hours, potentially affecting customer experience. This approach doesn't address the variable nature of the workload.<br>B. Changing to on-demand capacity could work but would likely be more expensive for this use case. On-demand pricing is generally higher than provisioned capacity pricing for predictable workloads with high utilization during specific periods.<br>D. Purchasing 1-year reserved capacity for peak load would be wasteful since the peak load only occurs for 4 hours each day. You would be paying for unused capacity during the remaining 20 hours, which is not cost-effective.<br>DynamoDB auto scaling provides the optimal balance between cost savings and operational simplicity for this specific use case with predictable traffic patterns. It automatically adjusts capacity to match the restaurant's daily traffic patterns while minimizing both costs and operational overhead.<br>Sources<br>Reduce latency and cost in read-heavy applications using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/reduce-latency-and-cost-in-read-heavy-applications-using-amazon-dynamodb-accelerator/）<br>Choose the right throughput strategy for Amazon DynamoDB applications | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/choose-the-right-throughput-strategy-for-amazon-dynamodb-applications/）<br>Amazon DynamoDB Reserved Capacity – Fast NoSQL Key-Value Database – Amazon Web Services （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/dynamodb/reserved-capacity/）<br>Evaluate your DynamoDB table's capacity mode - Amazon DynamoDB （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/CostOptimization_TableCapacityMode.html）<br>Minimize DynamoDB costs | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/dynamodb-minimize-costs）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use AWS AppSync and leverage WebSockets to deliver comments.<br>This solution will best reduce comment latency and improve user experience for the following reasons:<br>Real-time Communication: WebSockets provide a persistent, bidirectional connection between the client and server, allowing comments to be pushed to users instantly as they are created. This is the only solution that enables true real-time updates without requiring users to take any action.<br>Reduced Latency: With WebSockets, new comments are delivered to users immediately when they're posted, eliminating the delay that would occur with traditional request-response patterns. This directly addresses the requirement to "reduce comment latency."<br>Enhanced User Experience: Real-time comment updates create a more engaging and interactive experience, as users can see conversations develop naturally without having to refresh the page or wait for periodic updates. This directly addresses the requirement to "improve user experience."<br>Efficient Resource Usage: WebSockets are more efficient than polling approaches, as they only transmit data when there's new information, rather than making repeated requests that often return no new data.<br>Scalability: AWS AppSync is designed to handle large numbers of concurrent WebSocket connections, making it suitable for a growing blog application with active user discussions.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. Using edge-optimized API with CloudFront to cache API responses would actually be counterproductive for real-time comments. Caching would delay the delivery of new comments, as users might see cached (older) versions of the comments section rather than the latest updates.<br>B. Polling the comments endpoint every 10 seconds creates unnecessary load on the backend and still introduces a delay of up to 10 seconds before new comments appear. This approach is inefficient and provides a suboptimal user experience compared to real-time updates.<br>D. Changing the concurrency limit of Lambda functions might improve the overall throughput of the API but doesn't address the fundamental issue of delivering comments in real time. It would still rely on clients repeatedly requesting data rather than receiving updates as they occur.<br>AWS AppSync with WebSockets is the only solution that fundamentally changes the communication pattern to enable true real-time delivery of comments, which is essential for creating the engaging user experience the company is looking for.<br>Sources<br>Amazon API Gateway - Serverless Applications Lens （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/amazon-api-gateway.html）<br>Amazon ElastiCache vs API gateway edge-optimized endpoint | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU4xZPFTZ3TASRtyDteJBM7Q/amazon-elasticache-vs-api-gateway-edge-optimized-endpoint）<br>Scale lambdas to tens of thousands concurrent runnings | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUjv5PAE_dQ56EXvEpkJ1WTQ/scale-lambdas-to-tens-of-thousands-concurrent-runnings）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create an SCP at the root level in the organization to deny the s3:CreateAccessPoint action unless the s3:AccessPointNetworkOrigin condition key evaluates to VPC.<br>This solution is the MOST operationally efficient way to enforce the requirement that S3 access points can be accessed only within VPCs for the following reasons:<br>Centralized Management: With hundreds of AWS accounts to manage, implementing a single Service Control Policy (SCP) at the organization's root level provides a centralized approach to enforce this requirement across all accounts. This eliminates the need to configure and maintain separate policies in each individual account.<br>Preventative Control: SCPs act as guardrails that cannot be overridden by account administrators. By denying the creation of access points unless they're VPC-only, this approach prevents non-compliant access points from being created in the first place, rather than detecting them after creation.<br>Minimal Maintenance: Once the SCP is deployed at the root level, it automatically applies to all existing and future accounts in the organization without requiring additional configuration or deployment steps as new accounts are added.<br>Consistent Enforcement: The SCP ensures uniform enforcement of the VPC-only requirement across all accounts, eliminating potential gaps or inconsistencies that might occur with decentralized approaches.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Select the Swap Environment URLs option.<br>This is the correct next step in completing a blue/green deployment in AWS Elastic Beanstalk for the following reasons:<br>Seamless Transition: The "Swap Environment URLs" feature is specifically designed for blue/green deployments in Elastic Beanstalk. It allows for an instantaneous switch of the CNAME records between the two environments, directing traffic from the old (blue) environment to the new (green) environment without downtime.<br>Built-in Functionality: This is a native feature of Elastic Beanstalk that's purpose-built for this exact scenario. It's the standard and recommended approach for completing blue/green deployments within the Elastic Beanstalk service.<br>Minimal DNS Propagation: When you swap environment URLs in Elastic Beanstalk, the change happens almost immediately because it's simply swapping the CNAME records within AWS's DNS infrastructure. This results in minimal or no downtime for users.<br>Easy Rollback: If any issues are discovered after the swap, you can easily roll back by performing another swap to return traffic to the original environment.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>A. Redirecting using Amazon Route 53 would require additional configuration and wouldn't be the most direct method when using Elastic Beanstalk's built-in functionality. While Route 53 can be used for more complex routing scenarios, it's unnecessary for a standard Elastic Beanstalk blue/green deployment.<br>C. Replacing the Auto Scaling launch configuration wouldn't redirect traffic to the new environment. Launch configurations define how new instances are created within an Auto Scaling group, but they don't affect routing of user traffic.<br>D. Manually updating DNS records to point to the green environment would be more complex and time-consuming than using the built-in "Swap Environment URLs" feature. It would also likely result in longer propagation times, potentially causing inconsistent user experiences during the transition.<br>The "Swap Environment URLs" option is the most efficient and reliable method to complete a blue/green deployment in AWS Elastic Beanstalk after creating and deploying to a new environment.<br>Sources<br>Swap the Environment of an Elastic Beanstalk Application - Blue/Green Deployments on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/blue-green-deployments/swap-the-environment-of-an-elastic-beanstalk-application.html）<br>Blue/Green deployments with Elastic Beanstalk - AWS Elastic Beanstalk （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.CNAMESwap.html）<br>Blue/Green deployment | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU39OiY-naQZ--BOKDcRkzTw/blue-green-deployment）<br>Seamless Production Deployment with Elastic Beanstalk | .NET on AWS Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/dotnet/seamless-production-deployment-with-elastic-beanstalk/）<br><br><br>

<br>The correct answer is C. This solution involves using Amazon S3 for storing uploaded images, which is a scalable and durable storage solution. By configuring S3 bucket event notifications to send messages to an SQS queue, the system can decouple image processing from the upload process. A fleet of EC2 instances can then process the images as they are received from the SQS queue. Using CloudWatch metrics to monitor the SQS queue depth allows for automatic scaling of EC2 instances to handle the workload. Finally, enabling Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket of processed images as the origin ensures fast content delivery to users worldwide.<br>1. Uploaded images stored in Amazon S3: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 is highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective for storing large volumes of images. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - It supports event notifications when new objects are uploaded, triggering downstream processing.<br>2. S3 event notification → Amazon SQS: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - SQS decouples the upload event from processing, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - If processing fails, messages remain in the queue for retry.<br>3. EC2 instances process messages from SQS: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Workers pull messages from SQS, process images (overlaying text), and store results in another S3 bucket. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Auto-scaling based on queue depth (CloudWatch metrics) ensures efficient scaling during peak loads.<br>4. Processed images in another S3 bucket + CloudFront: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 is ideal for serving static content (processed images). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - CloudFront (CDN) improves global access speed by caching images at edge locations. &nbsp;<br> Why the other options are suboptimal:<br>- A: Uses EFS for storage, which is expensive for large-scale object storage (better for shared file systems). Also, relying on CloudWatch Logs for processing logic is inefficient. &nbsp;<br>- B: Uses SNS (pub/sub) instead of SQS (queue), which lacks message retention if workers fail. Also, EFS is unnecessary for processed images (S3 is better). &nbsp;<br>- D: Uses shared EBS, which doesn’t scale well globally and introduces single-point failure risks. Spot Instances are risky for critical workloads, and DynamoDB adds unnecessary complexity.<br> Key AWS Services in C:<br>✅ Amazon S3 (storage) &nbsp;<br>✅ SQS (decoupled processing) &nbsp;<br>✅ EC2 + Auto Scaling (processing) &nbsp;<br>✅ CloudFront (fast global delivery) &nbsp;<br>

<br>The correct answer is D. Amazon Aurora global databases allow for a single database cluster that spans multiple AWS Regions, providing fast local reads with low latency in each region. By converting the RDS for MySQL DB instance to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster and adding eu-west-1 as a secondary Region, the company can meet the requirement for real-time updates and low latency for customers in Europe. Write forwarding ensures that write operations are forwarded from the secondary region to the primary region, maintaining data consistency across regions.<br> Requirements:<br>1. Global Read/Write Access: Customers in both the US (us-east-1) and Europe (eu-west-1) need to write to the database.<br>2. Real-Time Updates: Both regions must see updates from each other in real time.<br>3. Low Latency: High application latency is unacceptable.<br>4. No Stale Data: Customers cannot tolerate stale data.<br> Why Option D is Correct:<br>- Amazon Aurora Global Database with Write Forwarding is the best solution because:<br> &nbsp;- It allows multiple regions to read and write while maintaining low-latency performance.<br> &nbsp;- Write Forwarding enables writes in the secondary region (eu-west-1) to be forwarded to the primary region (us-east-1), ensuring real-time consistency.<br> &nbsp;- Aurora Global Database provides fast replication (typically &lt; 1 second) across regions.<br> &nbsp;- It eliminates the need for complex replication setups or manual failovers.<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- Option A: Promotes an Aurora Replica to standalone, which breaks replication and doesn't provide real-time sync between regions.<br>- Option B: Cross-Region replicas in RDS for MySQL are read-only, so writes in eu-west-1 would not be possible.<br>- Option C: Logical replication introduces lag and complexity, and RDS for MySQL does not natively support write forwarding.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. By disassociating the Elastic IP from the EC2 instance and creating an AWS Transfer Family server with a VPC-hosted, internet-facing endpoint, the architect can maintain the same IP address for customer connections while improving availability and reducing management complexity. The security group can be attached to the new endpoint to maintain the existing access controls. Pointing the Transfer Family server to an S3 bucket allows for scalable file storage and synchronization from the existing SFTP server.<br> Requirements:<br>1. Improve availability: The current single EC2 instance is a single point of failure. The solution must provide high availability.<br>2. Minimize infrastructure management complexity: Moving to a managed service (like AWS Transfer Family) reduces operational overhead.<br>3. Minimize disruption to customers: Customers must continue connecting the same way (using the same Elastic IP and SSH authentication).<br>4. No change to customer connection method: The Elastic IP and security group rules must remain intact.<br> Why Option B?<br>- AWS Transfer Family is a managed SFTP service that provides high availability and scalability without managing servers.<br>- By configuring a VPC-hosted, internet-facing endpoint, the Transfer Family server can reuse the existing Elastic IP and security group (allowing customer IPs), ensuring no changes for customers.<br>- Amazon S3 is a durable and highly available storage backend for the files.<br>- The solution syncs files from the old SFTP server to S3, ensuring continuity.<br> Why Not Other Options?<br>- Option A: Uses a publicly accessible endpoint for Transfer Family, which doesn’t allow attaching the existing security group (required for customer IP restrictions).<br>- Option C: Uses Fargate + EFS + NLB, which introduces unnecessary complexity (managing containers, load balancers, and file sync) compared to the managed AWS Transfer Family.<br>- Option D: Uses multi-attach EBS + Auto Scaling + NLB, which is overly complex and doesn’t leverage managed services effectively.<br> Key Points:<br>- AWS Transfer Family is the best-managed solution for SFTP with built-in HA.<br>- Reusing the Elastic IP and security group ensures no customer disruption.<br>- S3 is the most scalable and durable storage option.<br>Thus, B is the correct answer. &nbsp;<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. Using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon S3 is a cost-effective way to handle streaming data. By using AWS Batch with Spot Instances for the nightly processing, the company can take advantage of lower Spot Instance prices while maintaining the flexibility to handle the processing if it fails. Setting a maximum Spot price that is 50% of the On-Demand price provides a buffer against market price fluctuations. This approach is more cost-effective than maintaining a fleet of Reserved Instances or using only On-Demand Instances, as it optimizes for both storage and compute costs.<br>Update the ingestion process to use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon S3. Use AWS Batch with Spot Instances to perform nightly processing with a maximum Spot price that is 50% of the On-Demand price. &nbsp;<br> Why? &nbsp;<br>1. Kinesis Data Firehose + S3: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Replacing the EC2 ingestion servers with Kinesis Data Firehose eliminates the need for Reserved Instances, reducing costs significantly. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Firehose automatically streams data to Amazon S3, which is highly durable, scalable, and cost-efficient for storage. &nbsp;<br>2. AWS Batch with Spot Instances: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Since the nightly processing is non-critical and can be retried, Spot Instances (at 50% of On-Demand price) are ideal for cost savings. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS Batch simplifies job scheduling and automatically manages Spot Instance fleets. &nbsp;<br>3. Cost Optimization: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No upfront Reserved Instance commitments. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Spot Instances provide the lowest compute cost for batch workloads. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- Option A: Uses On-Demand Instances (more expensive than Spot). &nbsp;<br>- Option C: Still relies on Reserved Instances (unnecessary cost since Firehose is serverless). &nbsp;<br>- Option D: Amazon Redshift is overkill for this use case (expensive for just nightly batch processing). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the most cost-effective, leveraging serverless ingestion (Firehose + S3) and cheap compute (Spot Instances via AWS Batch). &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer is A. By creating an AWS Transfer Family server and configuring it with an internet-facing VPC endpoint, the company can provide a secure and scalable SFTP solution. Assigning an Elastic IP address to each subnet ensures that external vendors have a set of static public IP addresses to allow. Using Amazon EFS for file storage provides high availability and is accessible across multiple Availability Zones. This approach requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages managed services and does not require managing the underlying EC2 instances or network infrastructure.<br>The question outlines the following requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate an on-premises SFTP site to AWS with high availability. &nbsp;<br>2. Provide external vendors with static public IP addresses (Elastic IPs) for allowlisting. &nbsp;<br>3. Use AWS Direct Connect for connectivity between on-premises and AWS. &nbsp;<br>4. Replace the NFS share with a highly available AWS storage solution accessible by downstream applications. &nbsp;<br>5. Minimize operational overhead. &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Correct: &nbsp;<br>- AWS Transfer Family is a managed SFTP service that eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances. &nbsp;<br>- Internet-facing VPC endpoint allows external vendors to connect via static Elastic IPs (required for allowlisting). &nbsp;<br>- Amazon EFS is a fully managed, multi-AZ file system that replaces the NFS share and provides high availability. &nbsp;<br>- Least operational overhead because AWS manages the SFTP server (Transfer Family) and EFS, reducing maintenance. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect: &nbsp;<br>- Option B: Lacks Elastic IPs, which are required for vendors to allowlist static IPs. &nbsp;<br>- Option C: Uses EC2 instead of AWS Transfer Family, increasing operational overhead (manual patching, scaling, HA setup). &nbsp;<br>- Option D: Uses FSx for Lustre, which is not a direct replacement for NFS (EFS is better suited). Also, migrating a VM to Transfer Family is not a standard approach. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option A is the best solution because it uses AWS Transfer Family (managed SFTP) with Elastic IPs and EFS (highly available NFS replacement), meeting all requirements with minimal operational effort. &nbsp;<br>

<br>The correct answer is A. This solution allows the architect to adopt the new AZ without needing additional IPv4 address space or causing downtime.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer is A. By creating a tag policy in the organization's management account, the company can define the allowed project tag values at the organizational level. Then, creating an SCP (Service Control Policy) that denies the creation of CloudFormation stacks without a project tag ensures compliance across all accounts within the organization. Attaching the SCP to each OU (Organizational Unit) simplifies the enforcement process and requires minimal effort compared to creating policies in each individual account or OU.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Enforce the use of project tags for new resources. &nbsp;<br>2. Ensure only predefined project tag values are used. &nbsp;<br>3. Minimize effort in implementation. &nbsp;<br>Option A is the best solution because: &nbsp;<br>- Tag Policy (AWS Organizations feature) enforces allowed tag values across all accounts in the organization. &nbsp;<br>- Service Control Policy (SCP) prevents CloudFormation stack creation unless the required `project` tag is included. &nbsp;<br>- SCP applies to all OUs, ensuring consistent enforcement without per-account or per-user configuration. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- B: Tag policies are set at the organization level, not per OU. This approach is redundant and less efficient. &nbsp;<br>- C: IAM policies require manual assignment to each user, which is more effort than using SCPs. &nbsp;<br>- D: AWS Service Catalog is a valid approach but requires more setup effort (creating portfolios, products, and sharing them) compared to tag policies + SCPs. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A is the most efficient solution because it leverages AWS Organizations features (Tag Policies + SCPs) to enforce tagging compliance at scale. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use the information about the application's CPU and memory utilization to specify CPU and memory requirements in a new revision of the Auto Scaling group's launch template. Remove the current instance type from the configuration.<br>This solution will meet the requirements with the LEAST number of configuration changes in the future for the following reasons:<br>Automatic Instance Selection: By specifying CPU and memory requirements rather than specific instance types, you allow AWS to automatically select the most cost-effective instances that meet your application's needs. This approach leverages AWS's built-in instance selection capabilities.<br>Future-Proofing: As AWS introduces new instance types with better price-performance ratios, your Auto Scaling group will automatically be able to use these new instances without requiring any configuration changes. The system will continuously select the most cost-effective option that meets your specified requirements.<br>Adaptability to Price Changes: When instance pricing changes over time, the Auto Scaling group will automatically adjust to use the most cost-effective instances that meet your CPU and memory requirements without requiring manual updates.<br>Right-Sizing Based on Actual Usage: Using the actual CPU and memory utilization data ensures that you're selecting instance sizes that match your application's real needs, addressing the underutilization issue directly.<br>Minimal Maintenance: Once configured, this solution requires virtually no ongoing maintenance or updates to continue optimizing costs as AWS's instance offerings evolve.<br>Option D (creating a script that selects instance types from the AWS Price List Bulk API) would require significantly more configuration changes in the future because:<br>The script would need to be regularly updated and maintained as AWS introduces new instance types or changes pricing.<br>Each time the script identifies better instance options, you would need to create a new revision of the launch template.<br>This approach introduces additional complexity and potential points of failure with the custom script.<br>It requires ongoing monitoring and manual intervention to ensure the script continues to function correctly.<br>By specifying CPU and memory requirements directly in the launch template, you create a more automated, self-maintaining solution that will continue to optimize costs with minimal future configuration changes, making Option C the best answer.<br>Sources<br>EC2 Instance upgrade or auto scale? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUKa8gFPuzTs2kC31vM5OiKA/ec2-instance-upgrade-or-auto-scale）<br>Migrate your Auto Scaling groups to launch templates - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/migrate-to-launch-templates.html）<br>Autoscaling group cannot update capacity despite sufficient service quota being available. | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUUx0Nl_XBTdiHpXthkeJvgA/autoscaling-group-cannot-update-capacity-despite-sufficient-service-quota-being-available）<br>COST09-BP03 Supply resources dynamically - Cost Optimization Pillar （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/cost_manage_demand_resources_dynamic.html）<br>Use multiple launch templates - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-launch-template-overrides.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Deploy a Lambda@Edge function to sort parameters by name and force them to be lowercase. Select the CloudFront viewer request trigger to invoke the function.<br>This solution will increase the cache hit ratio as quickly as possible for the following reasons:<br>Root Cause Targeting: The problem is specifically identified as inconsistently ordered query strings and mixed-case letters in the URLs. Lambda@Edge with a viewer request trigger directly addresses both of these issues by normalizing the query parameters before CloudFront processes the request.<br>Complete Solution: This approach solves both problems simultaneously:<br>It sorts the parameters by name, ensuring consistent ordering regardless of how they're submitted<br>It forces all parameters to lowercase, eliminating case sensitivity issues<br>Preserves Functionality: Unlike disabling query string caching altogether (option B), this solution maintains the ability to cache based on query parameters, which is likely important for the application's functionality.<br>Immediate Effect: Once deployed, the Lambda@Edge function will immediately begin normalizing all incoming requests, quickly improving the cache hit ratio without requiring changes to the application code.<br>Flexibility: If additional normalization is needed in the future, the Lambda function can be updated to handle new requirements.<br>The other options have significant limitations:<br>B. Updating the CloudFront distribution to disable caching based on query string parameters would likely break application functionality if those parameters are meaningful for content differentiation. This is a blunt approach that doesn't address the actual problem and could negatively impact the application.<br>D. There is no built-in CloudFront setting for "casing-insensitive query string processing." CloudFront treats query strings as case-sensitive by default, and there isn't a simple configuration option to change this behavior. This option doesn't exist as described and wouldn't address the ordering issue even if it did.<br>Lambda@Edge is specifically designed for this type of request manipulation and is the most appropriate solution for normalizing query strings before they reach the CloudFront cache. By implementing option A, the company can quickly improve the cache hit ratio while maintaining all the functionality of their web application.<br>Sources<br>Increase the proportion of requests that are served directly from the CloudFront caches (cache hit ratio) - Amazon CloudFront （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cache-hit-ratio.html）<br>Lambda@Edge example functions - Amazon CloudFront （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-examples.html）<br>Cloudfront CDN is not working with Videos | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUZrZsoVf9SwuBr3loEgCk-Q/cloudfront-cdn-is-not-working-with-videos）<br>CloudFront will miss cache if request is from CURL | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUqHQyupGdTgqf6vAqGle1Lg/cloudfront-will-miss-cache-if-request-is-from-curl）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Create a DMS change data capture (CDC) task that replicates the ongoing changes from the Aurora database to an Amazon S3 bucket in another Region.<br>This solution will meet the RPO requirement of 1 hour with the LOWEST cost for the following reasons:<br>Cost-Effectiveness: Among the options presented, AWS DMS with CDC to S3 is the most cost-effective solution for cross-region replication. S3 storage is significantly less expensive than maintaining a full Aurora database replica in another region. You only pay for:<br>The DMS replication instance (which can be sized appropriately)<br>S3 storage costs (which are much lower than Aurora storage)<br>Data transfer costs (which would be incurred with any solution)<br>RPO Compliance: AWS DMS with CDC can easily meet the 1-hour RPO requirement. CDC captures changes continuously and can be configured to replicate these changes to the target S3 bucket at frequencies well under 1 hour.<br>Appropriate for Write-Heavy Workloads: The scenario mentions "a large number of write transactions throughout the day." DMS with CDC is designed specifically to efficiently capture and replicate ongoing changes, making it suitable for write-intensive workloads.<br>The other options have significant cost disadvantages:<br>A. Aurora Global Database would provide the lowest RPO (typically less than 1 second), but at a much higher cost. It requires maintaining a full secondary Aurora cluster in the destination region, including compute instances and storage. This is overkill for an RPO requirement of 1 hour and would be significantly more expensive than the DMS to S3 approach.<br>B. Using Aurora Backtrack with Lambda to copy snapshots daily would not meet the 1-hour RPO requirement. Daily snapshots would result in an RPO of up to 24 hours, which exceeds the specified requirement. Even if modified to run hourly, this approach would be less efficient and potentially more costly than DMS with CDC for a database with frequent write transactions.<br>While the DMS to S3 solution may require additional steps during recovery (restoring from S3 to a new Aurora cluster), this trade-off is acceptable given the significant cost savings and the ability to meet the 1-hour RPO requirement. The company can restore from S3 to a new Aurora cluster in the DR region only when needed, avoiding the ongoing costs of maintaining a full secondary database.<br>Sources<br>Comparing Amazon Aurora Replicas, Aurora cross-Region Replicas, and Aurora global databases - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/aurora-replication-options/introduction.html）<br>Disaster recovery options in the cloud - Disaster Recovery of Workloads on AWS: Recovery in the Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html）<br>Automated Backup and Restore Solution for Cross-Region Aurora MySQL Databases | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUhC-a3j4USkKFB7-_MCi--A/automated-backup-and-restore-solution-for-cross-region-aurora-mysql-databases）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer because it involves the least development effort by creating a new AMI with the SSM Agent for automated patching and setting up an Auto Scaling group with smaller instances for high availability. Additionally, migrating the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL is less effort than the other database migration options since it's a compatible choice with the existing MySQL database.<br> Key Requirements:<br>1. High Availability: The current setup has a single EC2 instance for both the application and database, which is a single point of failure.<br>2. Performance Issues: The application server CPU often reaches 100%, causing downtime.<br>3. Patching Issues: Manual patching causes downtime.<br>4. Least Development Effort: The solution should minimize code changes or rearchitecting.<br> Why Option D is Best:<br>- Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Replaces the single large EC2 instance with multiple smaller instances behind a load balancer, improving scalability and availability.<br>- AWS Systems Manager (SSM): Automates patching without downtime (replacing manual patching).<br>- Amazon Aurora MySQL: Provides a highly available, scalable, and managed database solution (replacing the single MySQL instance). Aurora is MySQL-compatible, minimizing migration effort.<br>- Least Development Effort: Uses AMI-based deployment (no need to refactor the app for containers or serverless).<br> Why Other Options Are Less Ideal:<br>- A (Lambda + DocumentDB): Requires rewriting the app for serverless and migrating to a non-relational database (high development effort).<br>- B (Graviton + DynamoDB): Switching to Graviton may require AMI/application changes, and DynamoDB is non-relational (may not fit the data model).<br>- C (ECS + Neptune): Containerization requires significant rework, and Neptune is a graph database (not a drop-in replacement for MySQL).<br> Summary:<br>Option D meets all requirements with minimal changes by leveraging Auto Scaling, SSM, and Aurora MySQL. <br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer because it allows for the creation of individual usage plans for each customer with specific request quotas through Amazon API Gateway. This approach provides a scalable and flexible way to manage customer-specific quotas for a Lambda function.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Quota per customer – Each customer should have a specific request quota for a given time period. &nbsp;<br>2. Flexible quotas – Some customers need higher quotas for shorter periods, meaning quotas should be customizable per customer. &nbsp;<br>3. Hundreds of customers – The solution must scale efficiently. &nbsp;<br>Why Option A is correct? &nbsp;<br>- API Gateway Usage Plans + API Keys allow you to define request quotas per customer. &nbsp;<br>- Each usage plan can specify: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Throttling limits (requests per second) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Quota limits (total requests per day/week/month) &nbsp;<br>- API Keys are assigned to customers, enforcing their respective usage plan. &nbsp;<br>- REST API with proxy integration is a valid way to invoke Lambda while managing quotas. &nbsp;<br>Why other options are incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- B: HTTP API does not support usage plans or API keys (only REST API does). &nbsp;<br>- C: Lambda concurrency limits are not per-customer quotas; they limit concurrent executions, not request counts over time. &nbsp;<br>- D: AWS WAF rate-based rules are not per-customer quotas; they apply globally and lack the granularity of API Gateway usage plans. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API with a proxy integration to invoke the Lambda function. For each customer, configure an API Gateway usage plan that includes an appropriate request quota. Create an API key from the usage plan for each user that the customer needs.<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer because it provides a fast migration strategy by using AWS Application Migration Service for the VMware cluster and AWS DataSync for the NFS server data over the 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection. This approach minimizes the migration time without the need for physical transportation of data or recreating VMs and software packages on AWS.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate 120 VMs (with diverse OS and custom software) quickly. &nbsp;<br>2. Migrate a 10 TB NFS server efficiently. &nbsp;<br>3. Use the existing 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection for the migration. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is the Best? &nbsp;<br>- AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is the fastest way to lift-and-shift VMware VMs to AWS with minimal downtime. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It replicates VMs directly from VMware to AWS over Direct Connect. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No manual reinstallation of software is needed. &nbsp;<br>- EFS + DataSync is efficient for migrating the NFS server: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- DataSync optimizes transfer over Direct Connect, speeding up the 10 TB migration. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EFS is a managed NFS-compatible service, eliminating the need to manage an EC2-based NFS server. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Worse? &nbsp;<br>- A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- VM Import/Export + Snowball is slow (manual exports, Snowball shipping delays). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Snowball is unnecessary since Direct Connect is already available. &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manually recreating VMs is time-consuming (installing software again). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- FSx for Lustre is overkill (optimized for HPC, not general NFS workloads). &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Snowball is unnecessary (Direct Connect is faster for 10 TB). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manual VM Import/Export + EFS copy adds extra steps, increasing migration time. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ B. Configure AWS Application Migration Service with a connection to the VMware cluster. Create a replication job for the VMs. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Configure AWS DataSync to copy the NFS server data to the EFS file system over the Direct Connect connection.<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer because it involves using an RSA key pair for field-level encryption with Amazon CloudFront, which allows the data-handling microservice to have the corresponding private key for decryption. This ensures that only the specific microservice can decrypt the sensitive data as required.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Encrypt sensitive survey data in transit through the application. &nbsp;<br>2. Only the data-handling microservice should decrypt it (no other microservices). &nbsp;<br>3. The architecture involves CloudFront → ALB → ECS microservices. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- CloudFront Field-Level Encryption (FLE) is the best solution for encrypting specific fields (e.g., survey responses) before they reach the ALB/ECS. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- RSA Key Pair ensures only the data-handling microservice (with the private key) can decrypt the data. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Public key is uploaded to CloudFront, which encrypts sensitive fields before caching/forwarding requests. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Private key remains with the data-handling microservice, ensuring no other component can decrypt the data. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS KMS symmetric keys are not suitable for CloudFront FLE (FLE requires asymmetric keys). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- KMS keys would allow any authorized service to decrypt, violating the "only data-handling microservice" requirement. &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Lambda@Edge + KMS symmetric key does not ensure end-to-end encryption (data is decrypted at CloudFront, then re-encrypted). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- KMS symmetric keys do not restrict decryption to a single microservice. &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Lambda@Edge + RSA private key encryption is backwards (private keys should decrypt, not encrypt). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- CloudFront FLE is a managed solution and more secure than custom Lambda@Edge encryption. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

<br>Option B is the correct answer because it involves creating a private hosted zone and associating it with the VPC while also enabling both DNS support and DNS hostnames attributes. Configuring the DHCP options set to use AmazonProvidedDNS ensures that the domain names are correctly resolved for both private and public instances within the VPC.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Turn on the Concurrency Scaling feature for the Amazon Redshift cluster.<br>This solution meets the requirements most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>Designed for burst workloads: Concurrency Scaling is specifically designed to handle unexpected bursts of usage, which is exactly what the company is experiencing with the deep audit analysis report.<br>Optimized for read queries: Concurrency Scaling is particularly effective for read-heavy workloads, and the scenario specifically mentions that the queries are "complex read queries and are CPU intensive."<br>Maintains service continuity: When enabled, Concurrency Scaling automatically adds additional cluster capacity when needed, ensuring that both read and write queries can be serviced at all times, which is a stated business requirement.<br>Cost-effectiveness:<br>Amazon Redshift provides up to one hour of free Concurrency Scaling credits per day, which may be sufficient for the burst usage described.<br>You only pay for what you use beyond the free credits, and the scaling clusters are automatically turned off when not needed.<br>There are no upfront costs or commitments required.<br>Simplicity: Turning on Concurrency Scaling is a simple configuration change that doesn't require building and maintaining additional infrastructure or monitoring systems.<br>Option C (using Lambda to add capacity through elastic resize operations) is less optimal because:<br>Elastic resize operations take time to complete and may cause a brief interruption in service.<br>The solution would require building and maintaining a Lambda function and CloudWatch alarms.<br>Once resized, the cluster would remain at the larger size (and higher cost) until another resize operation is performed, even if the burst workload has completed.<br>There would be a delay between reaching the CPU threshold and completing the resize operation, during which performance could be degraded.<br>Concurrency Scaling provides a more elegant, purpose-built solution for this exact scenario - handling burst workloads while maintaining service levels for all queries, with minimal operational overhead and cost-effective pricing.<br>Sources<br>Concurrency scaling - Amazon Redshift （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/concurrency-scaling.html）<br>Scale read and write workloads with Amazon Redshift | AWS Big Data Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/scale-read-and-write-workloads-with-amazon-redshift/）<br>Amazon Redshift Concurrency Scaling - Amazon Web Services （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/redshift/features/concurrency-scaling/）<br>

<br>Option A is the correct answer because it sets up a private repository in Amazon ECR with a permissions policy that restricts access to only those accounts within the organization, ensuring security. Additionally, the lifecycle rule helps manage untagged images efficiently, reducing operational overhead.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Restrict ECR access to accounts within the organization (security). &nbsp;<br>2. Retain all tagged images (compliance/rollback needs). &nbsp;<br>3. Keep only the 5 most recent untagged images (storage optimization). &nbsp;<br>4. Minimize operational overhead (automated, no manual cleanup). &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- Private ECR repository ensures only authorized users can access images. &nbsp;<br>- Repository policy with `aws:PrincipalOrgID` restricts access to organization members. &nbsp;<br>- Lifecycle rule automatically deletes untagged images beyond the 5 most recent (no manual intervention). &nbsp;<br>- Least operational overhead (fully managed by AWS, no Lambda/EventBridge needed). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Public repositories are insecure (anyone can pull images, violating isolation). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- IAM role assumption adds unnecessary complexity. &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manual cleanup via Lambda/EventBridge increases operational overhead (lifecycle rules are simpler). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Hardcoding account IDs is not scalable (vs. `aws:PrincipalOrgID`). &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Public repositories are insecure (violates access control requirements). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- VPC endpoints are irrelevant (access control should be policy-based, not network-based). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Lambda/EventBridge cleanup is more complex than lifecycle rules. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ A.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer because it utilizes AWS Backup's cross-account management feature to create and apply a backup plan with the desired frequency and retention settings. This approach allows for a consolidated view of the backup status across all accounts with minimal operational overhead.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Take RDS snapshots every 6 hours (higher frequency than daily). &nbsp;<br>2. Retain snapshots for 30 days (longer retention than 7 days). &nbsp;<br>3. Consolidated view of backup health across all accounts (using AWS Organizations). &nbsp;<br>4. Minimize operational overhead (automated, no manual scripting). &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- AWS Backup is the managed service designed for centralized backup management. &nbsp;<br>- Cross-account management allows backups to be managed from a central account (aligned with AWS Organizations). &nbsp;<br>- Backup plan easily configures 6-hour snapshots + 30-day retention. &nbsp;<br>- Tag-based application ensures only relevant RDS instances are included. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Backup Dashboard provides a consolidated view of backup status across accounts. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Amazon RDS does not natively support cross-account snapshot policies (AWS Backup is required for centralized management). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No built-in way to enforce 6-hour snapshots (only manual or AWS Backup can do this). &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overly complex (CloudFormation stack sets + Lambda + EventBridge introduce unnecessary overhead). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS Backup already provides monitoring—no need for custom Lambda functions. &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) is for EBS snapshots, not RDS (AWS Backup is the correct service for RDS). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires manual setup in each account, violating the "consolidated view" requirement. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ A. Turn on the cross-account management feature in AWS Backup. Create a backup plan that specifies the frequency and retention requirements. Add a tag to the DB instances. Apply the backup plan by using tags. Use AWS Backup to monitor the status of the backups.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct combination of steps that the solutions architect must take to allow an IAM user in Account A to assume a role in Account B are:<br>A. Configure the SCP for Account A to allow the action. <br>C. Configure the identity-based policy on the user in Account A to allow the action. <br>E. Configure the trust policy on the target role in Account B to allow the action.<br>Here's why these three steps are necessary:<br>Configure the SCP for Account A to allow the action (A):<br>Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations set the maximum permissions boundary for accounts.<br>If there are restrictive SCPs in place, they could block the sts:AssumeRole action even if other policies allow it.<br>The SCP must not deny the ability for users in Account A to perform the sts:AssumeRole action.<br>Configure the identity-based policy on the user in Account A to allow the action (C):<br>The IAM user in Account A needs explicit permission to assume the specific role in Account B.<br>This is done by attaching an identity-based policy to the user (or to a group the user belongs to) that includes the sts:AssumeRole permission for the specific role ARN in Account B.<br>Without this permission, the user cannot initiate the role assumption process.<br>Configure the trust policy on the target role in Account B to allow the action (E):<br>The role in Account B must trust the IAM user from Account A to assume it.<br>This is configured in the role's trust policy, which specifies which principals (in this case, the user from Account A) are allowed to assume the role.<br>Without this trust relationship, the role will reject assumption attempts even if the user has permission to try.<br>The other options are not required:<br>B. Configure the resource-based policies to allow the action - While a trust policy is a type of resource-based policy, this option is referring to other resource-based policies, which are not necessary for cross-account role assumption.<br>D. Configure the identity-based policy on the user in Account B to allow the action - This is incorrect because there is no user in Account B involved in this scenario. The requirement is for a user in Account A to assume a role in Account B.<br>In summary, cross-account role assumption requires coordination between policies in both accounts: the permission to assume the role (in Account A) and the trust relationship allowing that assumption (in Account B), all within the boundaries set by any applicable SCPs.<br>Sources<br>How to allow an IAM user in Account A to assume a role in Account B in an AWS organization | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU0DuguIVGSAO8tK80hP_E7w/how-to-allow-an-iam-user-in-account-a-to-assume-a-role-in-account-b-in-an-aws-organization）<br>Four ways to grant cross-account access in AWS | AWS Security Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/four-ways-to-grant-cross-account-access-in-aws/）<br>Effectively implementing resource controls policies in a multi-account environment | AWS Security Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/effectively-implementing-resource-controls-policies-in-a-multi-account-environment/）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer because it uses AWS Storage Gateway's file gateway, which supports NFS, and the S3 Lifecycle rule to move files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 days. This option is cost-effective for long-term archiving and retrieval that can tolerate a few days of delay, as it provides the lowest storage cost for archiving data that is infrequently accessed.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Support NFS (since the on-premises file storage uses NFS). &nbsp;<br>2. Archive backups after 5 days (with a willingness to wait days for retrieval if needed). &nbsp;<br>3. Cost-effective solution (prioritizing lower storage costs for archived data). &nbsp;<br> Why Option D is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- Storage Gateway File Gateway provides NFS support, matching the on-premises file storage solution. &nbsp;<br>- S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective storage class for long-term backups that are rarely accessed (retrieval times of 12+ hours are acceptable per the requirement). &nbsp;<br>- Lifecycle rule automates the transition from S3 Standard to Glacier Deep Archive after 5 days. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Uses S3 Standard-IA, which is not cost-effective for long-term archiving (higher cost than Glacier Deep Archive). &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Volume Gateway is for block storage (iSCSI), not file storage (NFS)—does not meet the NFS requirement. &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Tape Gateway is for backup to virtual tapes, not file storage (NFS)—does not meet the NFS requirement. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- S3 Standard-IA is again not cost-effective for archiving. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ D. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway that is associated with an S3 bucket. Move the files from the on-premises file storage solution to the file gateway.

<br>Option C is the correct answer because it leverages Amazon DynamoDB global tables to maintain game metadata across Regions, which simplifies the data management and replication process. Additionally, using Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing ensures that users connect to the Region with the least latency, and attaching the Auto Scaling group to an NLB in each Region allows for scaling to handle variable loads with minimal operational overhead.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Global availability (game must run in multiple Regions). &nbsp;<br>2. Low-latency connections (users must automatically connect to the nearest Region). &nbsp;<br>3. Cross-Region data consistency (leaderboards, inventory, and event status must sync globally). &nbsp;<br>4. Scalability (any Region should handle the load of all Regions). &nbsp;<br>5. Minimal operational overhead (fully managed services preferred). &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- Auto Scaling + NLB ensures scalability within each Region. &nbsp;<br>- Route 53 latency-based routing automatically directs users to the closest Region (lowest latency). &nbsp;<br>- DynamoDB Global Tables provide multi-Region replication with low-latency reads/writes, meeting the cross-Region data requirement. &nbsp;<br>- Fully managed services (no manual replication or DNS logic required). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Global Accelerator + RDS read replicas adds unnecessary complexity (Global Accelerator is for fixed endpoints, not dynamic scaling). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- RDS cross-Region replication has higher latency than DynamoDB Global Tables. &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Geoproximity routing is less precise than latency-based routing. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manual MySQL replication increases operational overhead (vs. DynamoDB Global Tables). &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 Global View is for monitoring, not load balancing. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Custom DNS logic violates the "least operational overhead" requirement. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Aurora Global Database is overkill (DynamoDB is better for leaderboards/inventory). &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ C. Create an Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances. Attach the Auto Scaling group to a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in each Region.

<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. High reliability (minimized failover time for firewall appliances). &nbsp;<br>2. Centralized outbound traffic inspection (all internet-bound traffic must pass through the firewall). &nbsp;<br>3. Deployment in a shared services VPC with routing from other VPCs. &nbsp;<br> Why These Options Are Correct? &nbsp;<br>- A. Deploy two firewall appliances in separate AZs → Ensures high availability (if one AZ fails, the other remains operational). &nbsp;<br>- C. Use a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) → GWLB is designed for third-party virtual appliances (like firewalls) and provides scalability + seamless failover. &nbsp;<br>- F. Create a VPC GWLB endpoint + update route tables → Directs all traffic through the firewall appliances (GWLB endpoint acts as the next hop). &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- B. Network Load Balancer (NLB) → NLB is not optimized for firewall appliances (GWLB is purpose-built for this). &nbsp;<br>- D. VPC interface endpoint → Used for AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB), not for routing traffic through firewalls. &nbsp;<br>- E.

<br>To implement a highly available architecture while addressing the licensing and configuration requirements, the architect should create a pool of ENIs with associated license files and store them in Amazon S3 (Option A), and use a bootstrap script to attach the correct ENI to the EC2 instance. Additionally, the database server IP address should be dynamically injected into the configuration files using the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (Option D), eliminating the need for manual updates or AMI recreation.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Legacy application requires MAC-bound licensing (must persist across instance replacements). &nbsp;<br>2. Configuration files use static IPs (must be dynamically injected since hostnames are not supported). &nbsp;<br>3. High availability (must survive instance failures without manual intervention). &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- ENI Pool with Pre-Licensed MACs: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) retain MAC addresses even when detached. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Pre-request licenses for the ENIs and store them in S3 (scalable, durable storage). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Bootstrap script automatically attaches the correct ENI and applies the license. &nbsp;<br>- Ensures HA: If an instance fails, a new one can attach the same ENI (preserving licensing). &nbsp;<br> Why Option D is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store for dynamic IP injection: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Store the database IP in Parameter Store (managed, secure). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Bootstrap script fetches the IP and updates config files at launch. &nbsp;<br>- Eliminates hardcoded IPs in AMIs, enabling flexibility and easier updates. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Storing licenses on an EC2 instance (not S3) is not scalable or durable. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AMI-based licensing is inflexible (requires rebuilding AMIs for new licenses). &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requesting new licenses on-demand violates the 12-hour vendor delay (breaks HA during failover). &nbsp;<br>- E: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Hardcoding IPs in AMIs is inflexible (IP changes require AMI rebuilds). &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ A. Create a pool of ENIs. Request license files from the vendor for the pool, and store the license files in Amazon S3. Create a bootstrap automation script to download a license file and attach the corresponding ENI to an Amazon EC2 instance. &nbsp;<br>✅ D. Edit the bootstrap automation script to read the database server IP address from the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and inject the value into the local configuration files.<br>

<br>Option C createsa cross-Region read replica of the RDS database in the new Region, which allows users to accessand  download reports from a database that is closer to their location. <br>The read-only traffic makes this solution suitable,as it does not require any write operations on the secondary database. <br>Configuring latency-based routing on Route 53 directs users to the closest available API Gateway API based on their &nbsp;geolocation, which minimizes latency for report downloads<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Minimize latency for European users accessing reports. &nbsp;<br>2. 90% of database traffic is read-only, making read replicas ideal. &nbsp;<br>3.

<br>Option B is the correct answer because it simplifies the setup by using a single VPC for all test environments, which reduces the complexity and operational overhead. By including a transit gateway attachment and related routing configurations within the VPC, test environments can communicate with the central server without the need for creating new VPCs or managing multiple accounts.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Automated creation/deletion of test environments (no manual intervention). &nbsp;<br>2. Each test environment is a single EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group. &nbsp;<br>3. Test environments must communicate with an on-premises central server (via transit gateway VPN). &nbsp;<br>4. Minimize operational overhead (simple, scalable solution). &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- Single VPC for all test environments reduces complexity (no need for multiple VPCs or accounts). &nbsp;<br>- Transit gateway attachment in the VPC enables on-premises connectivity once (shared by all test environments). &nbsp;<br>- CloudFormation automates deployment of EC2 instances (Auto Scaling) and networking. &nbsp;<br>- Least operational overhead: No need for StackSets, multi-account setups, or container orchestration. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Deploying a new VPC per test environment is overly complex (transit gateway attachments and routing must be repeated). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- StackSets add unnecessary management overhead (single VPC is simpler). &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Creating new accounts per test environment is excessive (violates "least operational overhead"). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- StackSets + multi-account OU introduces unnecessary complexity. &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Containerizing EC2 instances + EKS is overkill for single-instance test environments. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Adds Kubernetes management overhead when simple Auto Scaling suffices. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ B.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Turn on EBS encryption by default in all AWS Regions.<br>This solution will meet the requirement to encrypt all new EBS volumes at rest with the least effort for the following reasons:<br>Built-in functionality: Enabling EBS encryption by default is a native AWS feature that doesn't require any custom code, additional services, or complex configurations.<br>Simple implementation: It's a one-time setting change per region that can be quickly enabled through the EC2 console, AWS CLI, or API.<br>Proactive approach: Once enabled, all new EBS volumes created in the region will be automatically encrypted at creation time, regardless of how they are created (console, CLI, API, or through services that create EBS volumes).<br>No ongoing maintenance: Unlike the other options, this solution doesn't require monitoring, updating code, or managing additional AWS services.<br>Comprehensive coverage: This setting applies to all EBS volumes created in the region, ensuring complete compliance with the encryption requirement.<br>The other options require significantly more effort:<br>A. Creating an EventBridge rule with Lambda would require writing code, setting up IAM permissions, testing the function, and monitoring its operation. It's also reactive rather than preventive, as it would delete volumes after they're created unencrypted.<br>B. AWS Audit Manager is primarily for compliance reporting and doesn't directly enforce encryption. It would help identify unencrypted volumes but wouldn't prevent their creation.<br>C. Creating an AWS Config rule with Systems Manager Automation would require setting up multiple services, creating automation documents, and ongoing maintenance. It's more complex and resource-intensive than simply enabling encryption by default.<br>Turning on EBS encryption by default is the most straightforward and effective solution to ensure all new EBS volumes are encrypted at rest, making it the option that requires the least effort to implement.<br>Sources<br>SEC08-BP02 Enforce encryption at rest - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-10-03/framework/sec_protect_data_rest_encrypt.html）<br>Data at Rest Encryption with Amazon EBS - AWS Key Management Service Best Practices （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/kms-best-practices/data-at-rest-encryption-with-amazon-ebs.html）<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Option C is the correct answer because it uses EC2 Instance Connect, which allows engineers to connect to their instances via SSH without the need to manage SSH keys. Instance Connect generates a new SSH key pair for each connection, and all connections are logged in CloudTrail, meeting both company policy requirements with minimal effort.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. No EC2 instance can use the same SSH key (unique keys per instance). &nbsp;<br>2. All SSH connections must be logged in CloudTrail (auditability). &nbsp;<br>3. Engineers must be able to SSH into instances for troubleshooting. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Correct? &nbsp;<br>- EC2 Instance Connect automatically generates ephemeral SSH keys (unique per session). &nbsp;<br>- No long-term SSH keys stored (complies with company policy). &nbsp;<br>- CloudTrail logs all `SendSSHPublicKey` API calls (meets audit requirements). &nbsp;<br>- Browser-based SSH client from the EC2 console simplifies access for engineers. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect? &nbsp;<br>- A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Storing SSH keys in Secrets Manager violates the "no same key" policy (keys must be unique per instance). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manual key management is error-prone and unscalable for hundreds of instances. &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Systems Manager documents cannot enforce unique SSH keys per instance (manual setup required). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No CloudTrail logging for SSH connections (only logs Systems Manager API calls). &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Daily key rotation is insufficient (keys must be unique per instance, not just rotated). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overly complex (Lambda + Secrets Manager + Session Manager for SSH is unnecessary). &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ C. Launch new EC2 instances without setting up any SSH key for the instances. Set up EC2 Instance Connect on each instance. Create a new IAM policy, and attach it to the engineers’ IAM role with an Allow statement for the `SendSSHPublicKey` action. Instruct the engineers to connect to the instance by using a browser-based SSH client from the EC2 console.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to send the data to Amazon DynamoDB.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Real-time data processing: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. It can handle the continuous stream of sensor data and make it available for processing within milliseconds of being received.<br>Schema-less database storage: Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that does not require fixed schemas. This makes it ideal for storing JSON data from sensors that might have varying structures or attributes over time. Each item in DynamoDB can have a different set of attributes, allowing for flexible data modeling.<br>JSON format support: DynamoDB natively supports JSON data, making it straightforward to store the sensor data in its original format without transformation.<br>Scalability: Both Kinesis Data Streams and DynamoDB are fully managed services that can scale to handle the high volume of data from multiple sensors across different areas in the city.<br>Let's examine why the other options don't fully meet the requirements:<br>A. Kinesis Data Firehose to Amazon Redshift - Amazon Redshift is a columnar database that requires a predefined schema. While Firehose provides real-time data delivery, Redshift doesn't meet the requirement for schema-less storage.<br>C. Amazon MSK to Amazon Aurora - While Amazon MSK provides real-time streaming capabilities, Amazon Aurora (whether PostgreSQL or MySQL compatible) requires defined schemas for tables, which doesn't meet the schema-less requirement.<br>D. Kinesis Data Firehose to Amazon Keyspaces - While Amazon Keyspaces is a NoSQL database that could potentially handle schema-less data, it's optimized for Apache Cassandra workloads and typically requires more schema definition than DynamoDB. Additionally, Keyspaces is less commonly used for this type of IoT sensor data compared to DynamoDB.<br>The combination of Kinesis Data Streams and DynamoDB is a well-established pattern for real-time processing of schema-less data in AWS, making it the most appropriate solution for the company's environmental data processing requirements.<br>Sources<br>Serverless Stream-Based Processing for Real-Time Insights | AWS Architecture Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/architecture/serverless-stream-based-processing-for-real-time-insights/）<br>Amazon Redshift data ingestion options | AWS Big Data Blog（https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/amazon-redshift-data-ingestion-options/） <br>Working with streaming data on AWS - Build Modern Data Streaming Architectures on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-modern-data-streaming-analytics-architectures/working-with-streaming-data-on-aws.html）<br>Architecture patterns to optimize Amazon Redshift performance at scale | AWS Big Data Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/big-data/architecture-patterns-to-optimize-amazon-redshift-performance-at-scale/）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create new Amazon DynamoDB tables for the application with on-demand capacity. Use a gateway VPC endpoint for DynamoDB to connect to the DynamoDB tables.<br>This solution meets all the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Private subnet requirement: The gateway VPC endpoint for DynamoDB allows EC2 instances in private subnets to communicate with DynamoDB without requiring internet access. This endpoint creates a private connection between your VPC and the DynamoDB service, ensuring that traffic doesn't traverse the public internet.<br>Encrypted connectivity: DynamoDB automatically encrypts all traffic in transit using HTTPS/TLS, meeting the requirement that all connectivity between applications and databases must be encrypted.<br>Scalability based on demand: DynamoDB with on-demand capacity automatically scales up and down based on the actual traffic patterns of your application. There's no need to predict capacity in advance, and the database will scale instantly to accommodate workload changes, perfectly meeting the requirement to scale based on demand.<br>Key-value database compatibility: Since the legacy application uses MongoDB as a key-value database, DynamoDB is well-suited as it's designed specifically as a key-value and document database service.<br>Option A (using Amazon DocumentDB with instance endpoints) doesn't fully meet the requirements because:<br>While DocumentDB is MongoDB-compatible, the instance endpoint approach doesn't provide the same level of automatic scaling as DynamoDB with on-demand capacity. With DocumentDB, you would need to manually add or remove instances to scale, or set up Auto Scaling, which is more complex than DynamoDB's on-demand scaling.<br>DocumentDB instance endpoints would require additional networking configuration to ensure private connectivity from the EC2 instances in private subnets, whereas the gateway VPC endpoint for DynamoDB is a more straightforward solution for private connectivity.<br>Provisioned IOPS volumes provide consistent performance but don't automatically scale capacity based on demand without manual intervention.<br>DynamoDB with on-demand capacity and a gateway VPC endpoint provides a fully managed, automatically scaling solution that meets all the security, connectivity, and scalability requirements specified in the scenario.<br>Sources<br>Migrating to Amazon DocumentDB - Getting Started with Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB Compatibility) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/get-started-guide.html)<br>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) - Choosing an AWS NoSQL Database （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/choosing-an-aws-nosql-database/amazon-documentdb.html）<br>Hosting MongoDB in AWS | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUXa08K95KROy1vpNJJQithA/hosting-mongodb-in-aws）<br>

<br>Option B is the correct answer. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is designed for migrating databases to AWS with minimal downtime. Using CDC with AWS DMS allows for continuous data replication from the source MongoDB database to the target Amazon DocumentDB, which is compatible with MongoDB.<br>AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is the recommended service for migrating databases to AWS, including migrations from MongoDB to Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility). Here’s why: &nbsp;<br>- AWS DMS supports Change Data Capture (CDC), which allows continuous replication of changes from the source (on-premises MongoDB) to the target (Amazon DocumentDB) with minimal downtime. &nbsp;<br>- It handles schema conversion (if needed) and ensures data consistency. &nbsp;<br>- The steps involve: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;1. Creating a DMS replication instance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;2. Defining a source endpoint for the on-premises MongoDB. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;3. Defining a target endpoint for Amazon DocumentDB. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;4. Creating and running a migration task (initial load + CDC for ongoing changes). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Running MongoDB on EC2 with synchronous replication is complex, costly, and not a managed solution like Amazon DocumentDB. &nbsp;<br>- C: AWS Data Pipeline is not designed for real-time or CDC-based database migrations; it’s better for batch data processing. &nbsp;<br>- D: AWS Glue crawlers are for metadata discovery (not database migration), and asynchronous replication is not a standard feature for this use case. &nbsp;<br>Thus, B is the correct and most efficient approach. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer. A Service Control Policy (SCP) in AWS Organizations can enforce compliance across multiple accounts, including restricting the deployment of resources to burstable types and disallowing the use of irrelevant services. Applying the SCP to the development OU ensures that all developer accounts follow the company's cost optimization guidelines.<br>To enforce cost optimization and restrict services in development accounts, AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) are the most effective solution. Here’s why: &nbsp;<br>- SCPs are preventive controls that define what AWS services, resources, or actions are allowed or denied across accounts in an OU. &nbsp;<br>- The requirement is to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Allow only burstable EC2 (e.g., T-series) and RDS (e.g., T-series) instances. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Disallow non-relevant services (e.g., expensive instance types or prohibited services). &nbsp;<br>- Applying an SCP to the development OU ensures all accounts under it comply with these restrictions. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B & C: AWS Control Tower guardrails are predefined compliance rules (either preventive or detective), but they do not support custom restrictions like allowing only burstable instances or blocking specific services. &nbsp;<br>- D: AWS Config rules are detective, not preventive—they check compliance after resources are created but cannot block actions proactively. &nbsp;<br> Key Takeaway: &nbsp;<br>SCPs (Option A) are the correct way to enforce cost controls at the OU level. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option A is the correct answer. By implementing a Lambda function that empties the S3 bucket before deletion, the architect can ensure that the S3 bucket gets deleted as part of the CloudFormation stack deletion process. The DependsOn attribute ensures the order of operations, allowing the bucket to be emptied before attempting to delete it.<br>The issue is that CloudFormation fails to delete an S3 bucket because it contains objects, and CloudFormation cannot delete non-empty buckets by default. The solution must: &nbsp;<br>1. Ensure the bucket is empty before deletion (without major architectural changes). &nbsp;<br>2. Integrate seamlessly with CloudFormation stack deletion. &nbsp;<br>Option A achieves this by: &nbsp;<br>- Using a Lambda-backed custom resource to programmatically delete all objects in the bucket. &nbsp;<br>- Adding a `DependsOn` attribute to ensure the Lambda runs before CloudFormation attempts to delete the bucket. &nbsp;<br>- This is a minimal change and follows CloudFormation best practices for cleanup. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B: Switching to EFS is a major architectural change (against the requirements). &nbsp;<br>- C: A lifecycle rule does not help—it only deletes objects after 45 minutes, but CloudFormation deletion is immediate. &nbsp;<br>- D: `DeletionPolicy: Delete` does not work for non-empty S3 buckets (default behavior already tries to delete the bucket). &nbsp;<br> Key Takeaway: &nbsp;<br>A custom resource (Lambda) to empty the bucket before deletion is the cleanest solution. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option C is the correct answer. Using Amazon API Gateway in combination with AWS Lambda allows for a serverless architecture that can scale automatically to handle varying loads. DynamoDB with on-demand capacity provides low-latency access to player session data and scales well with the game's needs.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1.

<br>Option D is the correct answer. Using AWS DataSync with a scheduled task to directly replicate data to Amazon EFS over a Direct Connect connection is the most operationally efficient solution.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Update ALB security group ingress to allow access only from the com.amazonaws.global.cloudfront.origin-facing CloudFront managed prefix list.<br>This solution will meet the requirement with the least amount of effort for the following reasons:<br>AWS-managed solution: The CloudFront managed prefix list (com.amazonaws.global.cloudfront.origin-facing) is maintained by AWS and contains all the IP addresses that CloudFront uses to route requests to origins. This means you don't need to manually track or update IP ranges.<br>Simple implementation: Updating the ALB security group to reference this managed prefix list requires just a single configuration change in the security group's inbound rules.<br>Automatic updates: When AWS adds or changes CloudFront IP ranges, the managed prefix list is automatically updated, ensuring your security configuration remains effective without any manual intervention.<br>No additional resources: This approach doesn't require creating any new AWS resources, just modifying an existing security group.<br>Option A (creating a new security group for CloudFront) is not feasible because:<br>CloudFront is a global service and doesn't run within your VPC, so you cannot attach a security group to a CloudFront distribution.<br>CloudFront uses a wide range of IP addresses that change over time, making it impractical to manually maintain a list of these IPs in a security group.<br>This approach would require ongoing maintenance to keep the IP ranges up to date, increasing operational overhead.<br>By using the AWS-managed prefix list in the ALB security group, you ensure that only requests coming through CloudFront can reach your ALB, effectively restricting direct access to the ALB endpoint.

Option B is the correct answer. This solution involves storing the Docker image in ECR across two regions and taking RDS snapshots every 8 hours, which aligns with the RPO requirement. In the event of a failure, the company can deploy necessary resources in the secondary region using AWS CloudFormation and restore from the latest RDS snapshot, which meets the RTO requirement. This approach is cost-effective as it does not maintain a hot standby environment continuously.

<br>The best solution that meets the requirements with the LEAST operational overhead is: &nbsp;<br> Option B &nbsp;<br>Create an organization in AWS Organizations. Enable AWS Control Tower on the organization. Review included controls (guardrails) for SCPs. Check AWS Config for areas that require additions. Add OUs as necessary. Connect AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to the on-premises AD FS server. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B? &nbsp;<br>1. AWS Control Tower – Provides a pre-configured baseline for security, compliance, and governance across multiple accounts with automated guardrails (SCPs) and centralized logging. This reduces manual setup and operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>2. IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) – Simplifies federation with on-premises AD FS, enabling seamless single sign-on (SSO) for users. &nbsp;<br>3. Organizational Units (OUs) – Allows grouping accounts by compliance requirements while maintaining a consistent baseline. &nbsp;<br>4. Least Operational Overhead – Control Tower automates many best practices (SCPs, logging, identity management), reducing manual configurations. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- Option A: Requires manual setup of SCPs, logging, and AWS Config, increasing operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>- Option C: Involves manual SCP and AWS Config management, which is less efficient than Control Tower’s automation. &nbsp;<br>- Option D: Uses IAM Identity Provider instead of IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO), which is less streamlined for AD FS integration. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion &nbsp;<br>Option B is the best choice because it leverages AWS Control Tower for automated governance and IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) for seamless AD FS integration, minimizing operational effort while ensuring compliance flexibility. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">DE</span>
<br>Option D is correct because using an Aurora global database provides cross-Region replication with low latency, which is suitable for read-only traffic. Option E is also correct as Amazon CloudFront can cache static content close to users worldwide, and Route 53 with latency-based routing can direct users to the nearest web tier, reducing response times. <br>Option D &nbsp;<br>Use an Aurora global database for physical cross-Region replication. Use Amazon S3 with cross-Region replication for static content and resources. Deploy the web and application tiers in Regions across the world. &nbsp;<br> Option E &nbsp;<br>Introduce Amazon Route 53 with latency-based routing and Amazon CloudFront distributions. Ensure the web and application tiers are each in Auto Scaling groups. &nbsp;<br> Why Options D & E? &nbsp;<br> Option D (Global Database & Multi-Region Deployment) &nbsp;<br>- Aurora Global Database – Provides low-latency reads in multiple regions with physical replication (faster than logical replication). &nbsp;<br>- S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) – Ensures static content is available globally with minimal latency. &nbsp;<br>- Multi-Region Deployment – Places web and app tiers closer to users, reducing response times. &nbsp;<br> Option E (CDN & Auto Scaling) &nbsp;<br>- Amazon CloudFront – Caches static and dynamic content at edge locations, reducing latency for global users. &nbsp;<br>- Route 53 (Latency-Based Routing) – Directs users to the nearest available endpoint for the best performance. &nbsp;<br>- Auto Scaling – Ensures the web and app tiers scale dynamically to handle traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- Option A: Replacing web servers with S3 is impractical (S3 is for static content, not dynamic web apps). &nbsp;<br>- Option B: Direct Connect is unnecessary for global performance (it’s for private network connectivity, not latency reduction). &nbsp;<br>- Option C: Migrating to RDS MySQL is a downgrade (Aurora is better for scalability and global replication). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion &nbsp;<br>D + E is the best combination because: &nbsp;<br>✔ Aurora Global Database + S3 CRR ensures low-latency data access worldwide. &nbsp;<br>✔ CloudFront + Route 53 optimizes content delivery and routing. &nbsp;<br>✔ Auto Scaling maintains performance during traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the online gaming application instances. Use Spot Instances for the analytics application.<br>This solution will meet the requirements most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>For the online gaming application:<br>The gaming application must always be available and runs continuously throughout the year<br>EC2 Instance Savings Plan is ideal for this workload as it provides significant discounts (up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing) in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage<br>This type of Savings Plan is instance-specific, allowing the company to commit to the exact instance types needed for the gaming application<br>Since the application runs all year, the company can maximize the utilization of their Savings Plan commitment<br>For the analytics application:<br>The key characteristic of this application is that it "can be interrupted and resumed without issue"<br>Spot Instances are perfect for this use case as they offer the deepest discounts (up to 90% off On-Demand prices) but can be interrupted with short notice<br>Since the analytics application is designed to handle interruptions, it can take advantage of Spot Instance pricing without compromising functionality<br>The data for the analytics application is stored in Amazon S3, so even if instances are terminated, no data is lost<br>Option A (using On-Demand Instances for the analytics application) would be significantly more expensive than using Spot Instances. On-Demand Instances provide flexibility without upfront payment or long-term commitment, but they come at a premium price compared to Spot Instances. Since the analytics application can handle interruptions, there's no operational benefit to paying the higher On-Demand prices.<br>The combination of EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the always-on gaming application and Spot Instances for the interruptible analytics application provides the optimal balance of reliability and cost-effectiveness.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>The correct answer is D. Here's the detailed reasoning:<br> Key Issues in the Current Setup:<br>1. Database Read Bottleneck: The MySQL database cannot handle read-heavy workloads during peak hours.<br>2. Static Content Management: Static content is stored on individual EBS volumes, which must be manually copied to each EC2 instance, causing inefficiency.<br>3. Scalability: The application cannot handle peak traffic due to fixed EC2 capacity.<br> Solution Analysis:<br>- Option A: <br> &nbsp;- Migrating to Lambda is not ideal for applications requiring persistent storage (static content on EBS). <br> &nbsp;- A single EBS volume cannot be shared across Lambda functions (they are stateless).<br> &nbsp;- RDS Multi-AZ improves availability but does not solve the read scalability issue.<br>- Option B: <br> &nbsp;- AWS Step Functions is not suitable for hosting a web application (it’s an orchestration service, not a compute service). <br> &nbsp;- While EFS solves the static content issue and Aurora Serverless v2 with a reader helps with read scaling, the compute solution is incorrect.<br>- Option C: <br> &nbsp;- Containerizing with ECS Fargate is a good approach for scalability. <br> &nbsp;- However, using a single EBS volume is problematic because EBS cannot be mounted to multiple tasks simultaneously. <br> &nbsp;- RDS Multi-AZ does not address read scaling.<br>- Option D (Correct Answer):<br> &nbsp;- Containerization with ECS Fargate: Enables automatic scaling of compute resources.<br> &nbsp;- Amazon EFS for Static Content: Provides a shared file system accessible by all containers, eliminating the need to manually sync content.<br> &nbsp;- Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 with a Reader: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Aurora Serverless v2 automatically scales database capacity.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- A reader instance offloads read traffic, solving the read-heavy bottleneck.<br> &nbsp;- Application Auto Scaling: Dynamically adjusts the number of ECS tasks based on demand.<br> Why Option D is Best:<br>- Solves database read scalability with Aurora Serverless v2 + reader.<br>- Solves static content management with EFS (shared across containers).<br>- Solves compute scalability with ECS Fargate + Auto Scaling.<br>- Maintains high availability and reliability.<br>

<br>Based on the requirements to ensure only AWS users or roles with suitable permissions can access an API Gateway endpoint and to have an end-to-end view of each request for latency analysis and service mapping, the answer is:<br>A. For the API Gateway method, set the authorization to AWS_IAM. Then, give the IAM user or role execute-api:Invoke permission on the REST API resource. Enable the API caller to sign requests with AWS Signature when accessing the endpoint. Use AWS X-Ray to trace and analyze user requests to API Gateway.<br>This is the correct solution because:<br>Setting the API Gateway method authorization to AWS_IAM ensures that only authenticated AWS users or roles can access the API. This directly addresses the requirement that "only AWS users or roles with suitable permissions can access the new API Gateway endpoint."<br>Granting the execute-api:Invoke permission to specific IAM users or roles provides fine-grained access control, allowing you to determine exactly who can invoke the API.<br>AWS Signature (Sigv4) signing of requests provides a secure authentication mechanism that verifies the identity of the requester and ensures the integrity of the request.<br>AWS X-Ray provides end-to-end tracing capabilities that allow you to:<br>Track requests as they flow through your application<br>Analyze latency at each step of the request processing<br>Create service maps that visualize the relationships between API Gateway and other services<br>Identify bottlenecks and troubleshoot performance issues<br>Option B is incorrect because:<br>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is primarily designed to control which domains can access your API from a web browser. While it's useful for browser-based security, it doesn't provide the IAM-based authentication and authorization required in the scenario.<br>Simply returning the company's domain in Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers doesn't restrict API access to specific AWS users or roles.<br>Amazon CloudWatch alone doesn't provide the comprehensive end-to-end tracing and service mapping capabilities that X-Ray does. While CloudWatch offers metrics and logs for API Gateway, it doesn't create the service maps needed to visualize request flows across services.<br>The combination of AWS_IAM authorization and X-Ray tracing in Option A provides both the security controls and the observability features required by the solutions architect.<br>Sources<br>CloudWatch integration with X-Ray - AWS X-Ray （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-services-cloudwatch.html）<br>Security design principles - Security Overview of Amazon API Gateway（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/security-overview-amazon-api-gateway/security-design-principles.html） <br>Securing Your AWS Infrastructure: A Zero Trust Approach | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/articles/ARDWfm5wKhROyIzu8gghrHKw/securing-your-aws-infrastructure-a-zero-trust-approach）<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. Here's the detailed reasoning:<br> Key Issues in the Current Setup:<br>1. Unplanned Downtime: Recent CloudFormation changes caused outages, indicating insufficient testing and risk mitigation.<br>2. Manual Deployment via User Data Scripts: Reliance on instance user data scripts is error-prone and lacks proper deployment controls.<br>3. Lack of Automated Testing & Safe Deployment Strategies: No structured way to validate changes before production.<br> Solution Analysis:<br>- Option A: <br> &nbsp;- While error detection and manual testing help, they are reactive and slow (manual testing introduces delays). <br> &nbsp;- Does not address the root cause (lack of automated validation and safe deployment mechanisms).<br>- Option B (Correct Answer):<br> &nbsp;- Automated Testing (CodeBuild): Ensures changes are validated in a test environment before production.<br> &nbsp;- CloudFormation Change Sets: Allows previewing changes before applying them, reducing unintended impacts.<br> &nbsp;- CodeDeploy with Blue/Green: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Eliminates dependency on user data scripts.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Enables zero-downtime deployments by shifting traffic only after validation.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Provides a rollback mechanism if issues arise.<br>- Option C: <br> &nbsp;- IDE plugins and CLI validation are helpful but static checks only (they don’t test runtime behavior). <br> &nbsp;- Manual testing in a staging environment is better than nothing but not scalable compared to automation.<br>- Option D: <br> &nbsp;- Blue/Green via CodeDeploy is good, but manual testing is inefficient and error-prone. <br> &nbsp;- Logging into instances for verification is not a best practice in cloud-native CI/CD.<br> Why Option B is Best:<br>- Prevents Downtime by validating changes before production (change sets + automated testing).<br>- Eliminates Risky User Data Scripts by using CodeDeploy’s controlled deployment strategies.<br>- Enables Fast Rollback with blue/green deployments if issues occur.<br>- Follows AWS Best Practices for CI/CD (automation, testing, and safe deployments).<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br>The question requires a solution that provides: &nbsp;<br>1. Dynamic scaling and resiliency in the primary Region (us-east-1). &nbsp;<br>2. Disaster recovery (DR) in an active-passive configuration with us-west-1. &nbsp;<br>Option B meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Deploying an ALB across multiple AZs in us-east-1 for high availability. &nbsp;<br>- Using Auto Scaling groups to dynamically scale EC2 instances. &nbsp;<br>- Replicating the infrastructure in us-west-1 (passive standby). &nbsp;<br>- Using Route 53 with failover routing and health checks to automatically redirect traffic to the secondary Region if the primary fails. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Incorrect because an ALB cannot span multiple Regions, and inter-Region VPC peering is not required for an active-passive setup. &nbsp;<br>- C: Incorrect because an ALB cannot span multiple VPCs/Regions, and Route 53 failover routing is missing. &nbsp;<br>- D: Incorrect because it suggests using separate Route 53 records without a failover policy, which does not ensure automatic failover. &nbsp;<br>Best Practice: &nbsp;<br>- Active-Passive DR requires Route 53 failover routing with health checks. &nbsp;<br>- ALB and Auto Scaling ensure scalability and resiliency within a Region. &nbsp;<br>- Inter-Region VPC peering is unnecessary for this scenario since the secondary Region is passive. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option D is the correct answer. Amazon ECS with the EC2 launch type provides full control over networking and host configuration, which is a requirement mentioned. Amazon Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 supports strongly relational database models, and Amazon SQS can be used for asynchronous messaging, replacing MSMQ.The question outlines the following requirements: &nbsp;<br>1. Containerized .NET Core components with complex orchestration. &nbsp;<br>2. Full control over networking and host configuration (implies EC2 launch type is preferred over serverless). &nbsp;<br>3. Strongly relational database model (requires a relational database, not NoSQL). &nbsp;<br>4. Asynchronous messaging (replacing MSMQ). &nbsp;<br>Option D meets all these requirements: &nbsp;<br>- Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type → Provides full control over networking and host configuration (unlike Fargate). &nbsp;<br>- Amazon Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 → A fully managed relational database compatible with SQL Server migrations. &nbsp;<br>- Amazon SQS → A managed queue service that replaces MSMQ for asynchronous messaging. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: AWS App Runner is serverless and doesn’t allow full control over networking/host configuration. Amazon EventBridge is for event-driven architectures, not direct MSMQ replacement. &nbsp;<br>- B: DynamoDB is NoSQL (not relational). Fargate removes host-level control. SNS is pub/sub, not a direct MSMQ replacement. &nbsp;<br>- C: Elastic Beanstalk is PaaS (less control than ECS). Aurora PostgreSQL is fine, but Amazon MSK is overkill for simple async messaging (SQS is better). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- ECS with EC2 launch type is ideal when fine-grained control over infrastructure is needed. &nbsp;<br>- Aurora MySQL/PostgreSQL is a good replacement for SQL Server in migrations. &nbsp;<br>- SQS is the AWS equivalent of MSMQ for decoupled messaging. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the scenario where a solutions architect is experiencing an insufficient capacity error when trying to add new EC2 instances to an existing placement group, the correct answer is:<br>B. Stop and start all the instances in the placement group. Try the launch again.<br>Here's why this is the correct approach:<br>When you create a placement group and launch instances in it, AWS attempts to place all instances close together on the underlying hardware to optimize network performance. However, as time passes and you try to add more instances, AWS might not have enough capacity available in that specific hardware section to accommodate the new instances while maintaining the placement group's requirements.<br>Stopping and starting all existing instances in the placement group forces AWS to re-evaluate the placement of these instances. When you restart them, AWS will attempt to find a section of hardware that can accommodate all your existing instances plus the new ones you want to add. This essentially gives AWS a chance to reorganize the placement group on hardware that has enough capacity for all your instances.<br>The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:<br>A. Use a spread placement group. Set a minimum of eight instances for each Availability Zone.<br>This doesn't address the current issue with the existing placement group<br>Changing to a spread placement group would require creating a new group and migrating instances<br>Spread placement groups are designed for distributing instances across separate hardware (reducing correlated failures), not for solving capacity issues<br>There's no setting for "minimum instances" in placement groups<br>C. Create a new placement group. Merge the new placement group with the original placement group.<br>AWS doesn't support merging placement groups<br>This approach wouldn't solve the underlying capacity issue<br>D. Launch the additional instances as Dedicated Hosts in the placement groups.<br>Dedicated Hosts cannot be used with placement groups<br>Placement groups and Dedicated Hosts are separate features with different purposes<br>The stop-and-start approach is a documented AWS best practice for addressing insufficient capacity errors in placement groups, as it gives AWS the opportunity to reallocate resources in a way that can accommodate all your instances together.<br>Sources<br>Placement strategies for your placement groups - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-strategies.html） <br>Why is my Auto Scaling group not launching new instances when the load increases? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUQsrSasV_Tyyqw_lB8W9Lfw/why-is-my-auto-scaling-group-not-launching-new-instances-when-the-load-increases）<br>Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance launch issues - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting-launch.html）<br>Placement Groups | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUV59mDpbkTNO3ZEGu1oRwmQ/placement-groups）<br><br><br>

<br>The core issue is that Auto Scaling replaces manually patched instances with unpatched instances from the original launch configuration/launch template. To prevent this, we need to: &nbsp;<br>1. Ensure new instances launch with the latest patches (Option D). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Automate AMI patching → Create a golden AMI with security updates. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Update the launch configuration/template → Point to the new AMI. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Trigger an Auto Scaling instance refresh → Gracefully replace old instances with patched ones. &nbsp;<br>2. Prioritize replacement of outdated instances (Option A). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Auto Scaling can be configured to first terminate instances using the oldest launch template (ensuring newer, patched versions persist). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Dual ASGs): Overly complex for this use case; instance refresh (Option D) is simpler. &nbsp;<br>- C (ELB + Health Checks): Doesn’t solve the patching issue—only ensures healthy instances. &nbsp;<br>- E (Termination Protection): Breaks Auto Scaling by preventing instance replacement. &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Instance Refresh is the AWS-recommended way to roll out updates to Auto Scaling groups. &nbsp;<br>- AMI lifecycle management ensures new instances are pre-patched. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the government agency's requirements to save EBS snapshots in at least two additional AWS Regions with the lowest possible operational overhead, the correct answer is:<br>A. Configure a policy in Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to run once daily to copy the EBS snapshots to the additional Regions.<br>Here's why this is the best solution:<br>Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) is specifically designed to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots. It has built-in functionality to copy snapshots across regions, which directly addresses the requirement to save snapshots in multiple regions.<br>DLM provides the lowest operational overhead among the options because:<br>It's a fully managed service that requires minimal setup and maintenance<br>It uses policies that can be configured once and then run automatically<br>It doesn't require any custom code or additional infrastructure<br>It handles scheduling, copying, and retention management automatically<br>DLM policies can be configured to run daily, which meets the implied frequency requirement, and can specify multiple destination regions for the copies.<br>The other options have significant drawbacks:<br>B.

<br>Based on the requirement to allow only the launch of t3.small EC2 instances in the us-east-2 Region for developers in a project account that cannot be part of the company's AWS Organizations, the correct answer is:<br>D. Create an IAM policy than allows the launch of only t3.small EC2 instances in us-east-2. Attach the policy to the roles and groups that the developers use in the project's account.<br>This is the correct solution because:<br>IAM policies provide precise control over what actions users can perform in AWS. By creating a policy that specifically allows only t3.small instances in us-east-2, you can enforce the restriction at the permission level.<br>The policy can be attached to IAM roles and groups that developers use, ensuring consistent application of the restriction across all developer accounts.<br>IAM policies are preventative controls that block unauthorized actions before they occur, rather than detective controls that identify violations after the fact.<br>This approach doesn't require any additional cost or resource provisioning - it's purely a permission-based solution.<br>Option C (Creating and purchasing t3.small EC2 Reserved Instances for each developer) is incorrect for several reasons:<br>Reserved Instances are primarily a billing construct for cost savings, not a security control. Purchasing Reserved Instances doesn't prevent users from launching other instance types.<br>Assigning specific EC2 instances to developers with name tags doesn't restrict them from launching additional instances of any size or in any region.<br>This approach would require ongoing management overhead to purchase and assign Reserved Instances for each developer.<br>It would incur unnecessary costs by requiring the company to purchase Reserved Instances for all developers, even if they're not always running instances.<br>The IAM policy approach directly addresses the requirement to restrict instance types and regions with minimal operational overhead and no additional cost.

<br>Question #352<br>A scientific company needs to process text and image data from an Amazon S3 bucket. The data is collected from several radar stations during a live, time-critical phase of a deep space mission. The radar stations upload the data to the source S3 bucket. The data is prefixed by radar station identification number. <br><br>The company created a destination S3 bucket in a second account. Data must be copied from the source S3 bucket to the destination S3 bucket to meet a compliance objective. This replication occurs through the use of an S3 replication rule to cover all objects in the source S3 bucket. <br><br>One specific radar station is identified as having the most accurate data. Data replication at this radar station must be monitored for completion within 30 minutes after the radar station uploads the objects to the source S3 bucket.<br><br><br>What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer. By creating a specific S3 replication rule that filters for the prefix of the radar station with the most accurate data and enabling S3 Replication Time Control, the architect can ensure that the data is replicated within the required 30-minute window. Setting up an Amazon EventBridge rule to monitor and alert on the replication time exceeds the threshold provides the necessary monitoring for compliance.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Replicate data from a source S3 bucket to a destination bucket in another account (already configured). &nbsp;<br>2. Ensure data from one specific radar station (identified by prefix) replicates within 30 minutes. &nbsp;<br>3. Monitor replication time and trigger alerts if the SLA is breached. &nbsp;<br>Option D meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Creating a separate replication rule for the high-priority radar station (filtering by prefix). &nbsp;<br>- Enabling S3 Replication Time Control (RTC) → Guarantees replication within 15 minutes (well under the 30-minute requirement). &nbsp;<br>- Monitoring replication time and triggering EventBridge alerts if delays occur. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: AWS DataSync is unnecessary for S3-to-S3 replication (native S3 replication is more efficient). Monitoring `TRANSFERRING` status doesn’t ensure timing compliance. &nbsp;<br>- B: Creating a separate bucket adds complexity without solving the monitoring requirement. &nbsp;<br>- C: S3 Transfer Acceleration improves upload speed to S3 but doesn’t help with replication timing. &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- S3 Replication Time Control (RTC) is the only way to guarantee replication within a defined timeframe (99.99% of objects within 15 minutes). &nbsp;<br>- Prefix-based filtering allows granular control over replication rules. &nbsp;<br>- EventBridge alerts can track replication metrics (e.g., `MaximumReplicationTime`). &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer. Deploying an additional NAT gateway in other Availability Zones and updating the route tables ensures that the application can access the internet from those zones. Modifying the RDS for MySQL DB instance to a Multi-AZ configuration provides database resilience across zones. Configuring the Auto Scaling group to launch instances across Availability Zones and setting the minimum and maximum capacity to 3 ensures that the application can continue to operate even if one Availability Zone is down.<br>The requirement is to ensure the application operates across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. The current setup has: &nbsp;<br>- Single EC2 instance (Auto Scaling min/max = 1) in one private subnet. &nbsp;<br>- Single NAT gateway (a single point of failure). &nbsp;<br>- Single RDS MySQL instance (not Multi-AZ). &nbsp;<br>Option A addresses all these issues by: &nbsp;<br>1. Adding NAT gateways in other AZs → Eliminates the NAT gateway bottleneck. &nbsp;<br>2. Converting RDS MySQL to Multi-AZ → Automatic failover to a standby in another AZ. &nbsp;<br>3. Configuring Auto Scaling to span AZs (min/max = 3) → Ensures instances run in multiple AZs. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Virtual private gateway is for VPN/Direct Connect (not needed here). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Aurora MySQL is good but doesn’t solve the NAT gateway issue. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Auto Scaling min/max = 3 is correct, but the rest is unnecessary. &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- NAT instance is less reliable than NAT gateway. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- PostgreSQL migration is irrelevant to resilience. &nbsp;<br>- D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Auto Scaling min/max = 1 means only one instance runs (no multi-AZ redundancy). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Backups don’t provide high availability (only disaster recovery). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Multi-AZ RDS ensures database failover. &nbsp;<br>- Multi-AZ NAT gateways prevent network bottlenecks. &nbsp;<br>- Auto Scaling across AZs ensures compute redundancy. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. Migrating the application to AWS Fargate for Amazon ECS allows the company to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure. Using Amazon EFS provides a shared file system that can be accessed by multiple tasks running the application, and it can automatically scale to meet the throughput demands. Fargate's serverless model aligns with the company's requirement to avoid further development and administration of the Docker environment.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate Docker containers without managing the hosting environment → AWS Fargate (serverless containers). &nbsp;<br>2. Shared storage for transaction data → Amazon EFS (scalable, low-latency shared file storage). &nbsp;<br>3. Automatic throughput scaling → EFS automatically scales IOPS based on demand. &nbsp;<br>4. No application changes → EFS provides a POSIX-compliant file system (compatible with existing storage). &nbsp;<br>Option B meets all these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using Fargate for ECS (no Docker host management). &nbsp;<br>- Configuring EFS as shared storage (attached via task definition). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Amazon S3 is not a file system (cannot be mounted directly by containers). &nbsp;<br>- C: EBS volumes cannot be shared across multiple containers (no shared storage). &nbsp;<br>- D: EC2 instances require Docker management (violates the "no administration" requirement). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Fargate + EFS is the standard for serverless containers with shared storage. &nbsp;<br>- EFS scales automatically and provides low-latency access for transactional workloads. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option C is the correct answer. By creating a new AWS CloudTrail trail in the organization's management account and configuring it to apply to all accounts in the organization, the solution provides a centralized auditing mechanism with minimal operational overhead.

<br>Based on the requirement for a distributed in-memory database with the lowest possible networking latency, the correct answer is:<br>C. Launch memory optimized EC2 instances in a cluster placement group.<br>Here's why this is the best solution:<br>Memory Optimized Instances:<br>A distributed in-memory database, as the name suggests, primarily relies on memory for data storage and processing<br>Memory optimized instances (like the R-series) are specifically designed with high memory-to-CPU ratios to support memory-intensive applications<br>These instances provide the necessary RAM capacity for storing the database entirely in memory, which is essential for optimal performance<br>Cluster Placement Group:<br>Cluster placement groups are specifically designed to provide the lowest possible network latency and highest packet-per-second performance between instances<br>They pack instances close together within a single Availability Zone on high-bandwidth, low-latency hardware<br>This placement strategy is ideal for applications that benefit from low-latency node-to-node communication, such as distributed databases where nodes need to communicate frequently for data replication<br>The other options are less suitable for the following reasons:<br>A. Memory optimized EC2 instances in a partition placement group:<br>While memory optimized instances are appropriate, partition placement groups are designed to spread instances across distinct hardware partitions<br>Partition groups help reduce the impact of hardware failures but don't provide the same level of network performance as cluster placement groups<br>This would not deliver the "lowest possible networking latency" required<br>B. Compute optimized EC2 instances in a partition placement group:<br>Compute optimized instances prioritize CPU performance over memory, which is not ideal for an in-memory database<br>Partition placement groups, as mentioned above, don't provide the lowest possible network latency<br>D. Compute optimized EC2 instances in a spread placement group:<br>Compute optimized instances are not optimal for memory-intensive workloads<br>Spread placement groups place instances on distinct hardware to maximize availability, but this comes at the cost of higher network latency between instances<br>This option would provide the highest network latency among all the choices<br>The combination of memory optimized instances (for the in-memory database requirements) and a cluster placement group (for the lowest possible networking latency) makes option C the optimal solution for achieving maximum performance in this distributed database scenario.<br>Sources<br>PERF04-BP06 Choose your workload's location based on network requirements - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2023-10-03/framework/perf_networking_choose_workload_location_network_requirements.html）<br>Placement strategies for your placement groups - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-strategies.html）<br>Improve network latency for Linux based EC2 instances - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ena-improve-network-latency-linux.html）<br>

<br>Based on the requirement to automate backups of approximately 1 million CSV files (10 TB initially, growing at 1 TB weekly) from on-premises to AWS Cloud with custom filters for specific directories, the solution with the least operational overhead is:<br>C. Install the AWS DataSync agent as a VM that runs on the on-premises hypervisor. Configure a DataSync task to replicate the data to Amazon S3 daily.<br>Here's why this is the best solution:<br>AWS DataSync is specifically designed for transferring large amounts of data between on-premises environments and AWS Cloud. It's purpose-built for this exact use case.<br>DataSync provides built-in filtering capabilities that allow you to include or exclude specific directories, which directly addresses the requirement to "apply custom filters to back up only a subset of the data that is located in designated source directories."<br>DataSync can efficiently utilize the existing Direct Connect connection, optimizing transfer speeds and providing secure data transfer.<br>The DataSync agent runs as a VM on your existing hypervisor, making deployment straightforward with minimal infrastructure changes.<br>DataSync tasks can be easily scheduled to run daily, meeting the requirement for daily backups.<br>DataSync handles the complexity of transferring millions of small files efficiently, which is important given the 1 million CSV files in this scenario.<br>DataSync provides detailed monitoring, logging, and verification of transferred data, reducing the operational overhead of manually checking if backups were successful.<br>Option B (AWS Backup) is not the optimal choice because:<br>AWS Backup is primarily designed for backing up AWS resources, not for transferring data from on-premises to AWS.<br>AWS Backup would require additional components like AWS Storage Gateway to handle on-premises data, increasing the operational overhead.<br>AWS Backup has more limited filtering capabilities compared to DataSync, making it harder to back up only specific directories.<br>For large-scale data transfer from on-premises to AWS, AWS Backup would be less efficient than DataSync, which is specifically optimized for this purpose.<br>AWS DataSync provides the most streamlined, purpose-built solution for this specific use case with the least operational overhead, making option C the correct answer.<br>Sources<br>AWS DataSync for Backup solution | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUK80Pmh1YRj60N53GDtl7UA/aws-datasync-for-backup-solution）<br>REL09-BP01 Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources - AWS Well-Architected Framework （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_backing_up_data_identified_backups_data.html）<br>Choosing what AWS DataSync transfers - AWS DataSync （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-options.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Option C is the correct answer. AWS Service Catalog allows for the creation of a catalog of approved resources and applications that users can launch. It enables the definition of specific permissions for eachuser persona, ensuring that they have least privilege access and can only launch authorized applications. It also supports resource tagging, which helps in tracking the resources created by each user.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Least privilege access for each user persona (Administrator, Data Engineer, Data Analyst). &nbsp;<br>2. Restrict launch to approved/authorized applications (controlled EMR versions/configurations). &nbsp;<br>3. Enforce tagging for all created resources. &nbsp;<br>Option C meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using AWS Service Catalog to: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Define approved EMR configurations (versions, cluster setups). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Assign IAM permissions per persona (e.g., Data Analysts can only run queries, not modify clusters). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Enforce tagging policies (via Service Catalog TagOptions). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: IAM roles + AWS Config lacks centralized control over approved EMR configurations. AWS Config only detects noncompliance (doesn’t prevent it). &nbsp;<br>- B: Kerberos authentication secures access but doesn’t address least privilege or approved application launches. &nbsp;<br>- D: CloudFormation + AWS Config enforces resource policies but doesn’t simplify user access control like Service Catalog. &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Service Catalog is the standard for pre-approved, governed AWS resource deployments. &nbsp;<br>- Tag enforcement ensures compliance and cost tracking. &nbsp;<br>- Least privilege is achieved by mapping IAM permissions to Service Catalog portfolios. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option B is the correct answer. By creating a new NLB in us-east-1 and using the IP addresses of the instances in eu-west-2 as the target group, the company can establish a PrivateLink endpoint service that allows the new customer to access the SaaS service without deploying new EC2 resources in us-east-1.

Provide access to the SaaS service (hosted in eu-west-2) to a new customer in us-east-1. &nbsp;<br>2. Avoid deploying new EC2 instances in us-east-1 (must reuse existing eu-west-2 instances). &nbsp;<br>3. Use AWS PrivateLink (secure, private connectivity). &nbsp;<br>Option B meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Creating an NLB in us-east-1 (required for PrivateLink endpoint services). &nbsp;<br>- Configuring an IP target group pointing to the private IPs of the eu-west-2 instances (traffic routes via inter-Region VPC peering). &nbsp;<br>- Setting up a PrivateLink endpoint service in us-east-1 using the new NLB (customer connects securely via PrivateLink). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: PrivateLink endpoint services cannot reference NLBs in another Region (must be in the same Region). &nbsp;<br>- C: ALB cannot be used with PrivateLink (only NLBs are supported). &nbsp;<br>- D: AWS RAM cannot share EC2 instances across Regions (only within the same Region). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Inter-Region VPC peering enables private connectivity across Regions. &nbsp;<br>- PrivateLink + NLB provides secure, scalable access without exposing resources to the public internet. &nbsp;<br>- IP target groups allow cross-Region routing (unlike instance/ALB target groups). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option B is the correct answer. Configuring AWS CodePipeline with AWS CodeDeploy for blue/green deployments allows for minimal downtime and quick rollbacks. This approach maintains two production environments, with one serving as a standby for the other. If issues are detected in the new deployment, the company can quickly switch back to the previous version, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Fast patch deployments with minimal downtime → Blue/Green deployment (avoids downtime by shifting traffic to new instances). &nbsp;<br>2.

CI/CD pipeline integration → CodePipeline + CodeDeploy (supports GitHub, CodeBuild, and automated deployments). &nbsp;<br>Option B meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using CodeDeploy with Blue/Green deployments (minimizes downtime and enables instant rollback). &nbsp;<br>- Monitoring + manual rollback (if issues arise, revert with a single action). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: In-place deployments cause downtime and lack automated rollback. &nbsp;<br>- C: CloudFormation alone doesn’t handle Blue/Green deployments for EC2 fleets (CodeDeploy is better suited). &nbsp;<br>- D: OpsWorks in-place deployments also cause downtime and lack native rollback. &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Blue/Green deployments are ideal for zero-downtime patching. &nbsp;<br>- CodeDeploy rollback ensures quick recovery from failed deployments. &nbsp;<br>- CodePipeline orchestrates the workflow (GitHub → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy). &nbsp;<br>

Answer is C. <br>To enforce the tagging requirement for EC2 instances across multiple AWS accounts in an organization, a solutions architect should implement the following measures:<br><br><br>1. Create a tag policy:<br>   - Use AWS Organizations to create a tag policy that defines the required "BusinessUnit" tag for EC2 instances.<br>   - Specify the tag key, allowed values, and enforcement rules in the policy.<br>2. Attach the tag policy:<br>   - Attach the created tag policy to the root of the organization or to specific Organizational Units (OUs) that contain the accounts running EC2 instances.<br>3. Enable tag policy enforcement:<br>   - In the tag policy, enable enforcement for EC2 instances to prevent the creation or modification of instances without the required tag.<br>4. Implement proactive controls:<br>   - Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to deny the creation of EC2 instances without the required tag.<br>   - This adds an extra layer of protection at the organization level.<br>5. Set up compliance monitoring:<br>   - Use AWS Config to create rules that check for compliance with the tagging policy.<br>   - Configure AWS Config to send notifications when non-compliant resources are detected.<br>6. Automate tag addition:<br>   - Implement AWS Lambda functions triggered by CloudTrail events to automatically add the required tag if it's missing when an instance is created or modified.<br>7. Educate and communicate:<br>   - Inform all teams about the tagging requirements and provide clear guidelines on how to properly tag resources.<br>8. Regular audits:<br>   - Schedule periodic reviews of resource tagging to ensure ongoing compliance.<br>9. Consider using AWS Resource Groups Tagging API:<br>   - This can help in managing tags across multiple accounts and services more efficiently.<br><br><br>By implementing these measures, the company can ensure that all EC2 instances have the required "BusinessUnit" tag, enabling accurate cost tracking for each business unit. Remember to test these policies in a non-production environment before applying them organization-wide, and always follow the principle of least privilege when setting up permissions and policies.<br>Sources<br>[1] [Best practices for managing organizational units (OUs) with AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous_best_practices.html)<br>[3] [Best practices for a multi-account environment - AWS Organizations] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_best-practices.html)<br>[6] [Implementing a tagging strategy for detailed cost and usage data - AWS Prescriptive Guidance] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cost-allocation-tagging/introduction.html)<br>

<br>Option C is the correct answer. By associating an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block with the VPC and subnets, and creating an egress-only internet gateway, the architect can ensure that the instances in private subnets use IPv6 for outbound traffic without being accessible from the public internet. An egress-only internet gateway allows outbound traffic from a VPC to the internet, but does not allow inbound traffic.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate EC2 instances to IPv6 while maintaining current networking behavior. &nbsp;<br>2. Private subnets must not be publicly accessible (IPv6 equivalent of NAT for IPv4). &nbsp;<br>Option C meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Associating an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block (ensures globally unique addresses). &nbsp;<br>- Creating an egress-only internet gateway (EIGW) → Allows outbound IPv6 traffic but blocks inbound traffic (like NAT for IPv4). &nbsp;<br>- Adding `::/0` routes in private subnets to the EIGW (ensures private instances can access the internet but remain unreachable from it). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Routes `::/0` to an internet gateway (IGW), making private instances publicly accessible (violates security requirements). &nbsp;<br>- B: NAT gateways don’t support IPv6 (they’re IPv4-only). &nbsp;<br>- D: NAT gateways cannot be IPv6-enabled (AWS doesn’t support IPv6 NAT). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Egress-only internet gateway (EIGW) is the IPv6 equivalent of NAT for private subnets. &nbsp;<br>- Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR blocks simplify address allocation (custom blocks are unnecessary). &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. Creating an interface VPC endpoint for API Gateway with private DNS naming enabled allows the EC2 instance within the VPC to communicate with the API Gateway using the VPC endpoint's DNS name. Attaching an endpoint policy that allows the execute-api:Invoke action and configuring an API resource policy to allow access from the VPC endpoint ensures secure and private connectivity.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Private REST API (accessible only from within a VPC). &nbsp;<br>2. API must be reachable from an EC2 instance in the VPC. &nbsp;<br>3. Current issue: API is not accessible from the EC2 instance. &nbsp;<br>Option B resolves this by: &nbsp;<br>- Creating an interface VPC endpoint for API Gateway (enables private connectivity from the VPC). &nbsp;<br>- Attaching an endpoint policy allowing `execute-api:Invoke` (grants API access permissions). &nbsp;<br>- Enabling private DNS naming (simplifies API calls by using standard API Gateway DNS names). &nbsp;<br>- Configuring an API resource policy to restrict access to the VPC endpoint (ensures security). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Disabling private DNS naming forces manual DNS configuration (adds unnecessary complexity). &nbsp;<br>- C: NLB + VPC Link is for integrating private backend services (not needed here; the issue is API Gateway access). &nbsp;<br>- D: ALB + VPC Link is also for backend integration (irrelevant for this use case). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Interface VPC endpoints provide secure, private access to AWS services (like API Gateway). &nbsp;<br>- Private DNS naming avoids manual endpoint URL management. &nbsp;<br>- API resource policies enforce least-privilege access control. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the scenario where a solutions architect needs to centrally manage billing and access policies for multiple AWS accounts after configuring AWS Organizations and sending invitations to member accounts, the correct next step is:<br>C. Create the OrganizationAccountAccessRole IAM role in each member account. Grant permission to the management account to assume the IAM role.<br>Here's why this is the correct answer:<br>The OrganizationAccountAccessRole is the standard IAM role that AWS Organizations uses to enable cross-account access from the management account to member accounts. This is a best practice recommended by AWS for organizations.<br>By creating this role in each member account and granting permission to the management account to assume it, administrators in the management account can access and manage resources in the member accounts. This enables centralized management of all accounts.<br>This approach follows the principle of role-based access control, which is more secure than sharing credentials or creating users in each account.<br>The OrganizationAccountAccessRole typically has administrative permissions in the member account, allowing the management account to perform necessary management tasks, including access policy management.<br>For billing management, AWS Organizations automatically enables consolidated billing once member accounts join the organization, allowing the management account to centrally manage billing for all accounts.<br>The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:<br>A. Creating an OrganizationAccountAccess IAM group in each member account is not the correct approach. IAM groups are collections of IAM users within a single account and don't facilitate cross-account access. Groups cannot be assumed like roles can, making them unsuitable for cross-account management.<br>B. There is no standard "OrganizationAccountAccessPolicy" in AWS Organizations. While custom policies can be created, they need to be attached to roles or users to be effective. Simply creating a policy without attaching it to a role that can be assumed by the management account wouldn't enable cross-account access.<br>Creating the OrganizationAccountAccessRole in each member account is the standard and recommended approach for enabling centralized management of AWS accounts within an organization, making option C the correct answer.<br>Sources<br>Managing account invitations with AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html）<br>AWS Identity and Access Management and AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-iam.html）<br>Manage member accounts - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts/manage-member-accounts.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer. Deploying the application on Amazon EKS with AWS Fargate allows the company to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure, which reduces operational overhead. Using an Application Load Balancer for auto scaling and Multi-AZ deployment with storage auto scaling for the RDS instance ensures high availability and scalability. Creating an Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka cluster provides a scalable and managed streaming platform for Kafka. Storing static content in Amazon S3 and serving it through Amazon CloudFront reduces latency and improves the content delivery experience for users.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Reduce operational overhead (automate scaling, minimize management). &nbsp;<br>2. Handle a surge in orders (scalable architecture). &nbsp;<br>3. Containerized services (needs orchestration). &nbsp;<br>4. Replace self-managed Kafka (reduce complexity). &nbsp;<br>Option D meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using Amazon EKS with Fargate → Serverless Kubernetes (no EC2 management, auto-scaling). &nbsp;<br>- Multi-AZ RDS + read replicas → Scalable, highly available database. &nbsp;<br>- Amazon MSK → Fully managed Kafka (replaces self-managed clusters). &nbsp;<br>- S3 + CloudFront → Scalable static content delivery. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A & B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EC2 Auto Scaling requires manual capacity management (higher overhead than EKS/Fargate). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Self-managed Kafka remains operational burden. &nbsp;<br>- C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 still requires node management (vs. Fargate’s serverless approach). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- EKS + Fargate eliminates node management. &nbsp;<br>- Amazon MSK removes Kafka operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>- CloudFront optimizes static content delivery globally. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the scenario where a company needs to support a growing remote workforce, reduce bandwidth usage for connections to their on-premises data center, and reduce operational overhead, the two steps that would meet these requirements with the least operational overhead are:<br>B. Migrate the home directories to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. D.

Creating an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway would still require maintaining an on-premises file server and would not fully address the bandwidth issue, as data would still need to be synchronized between AWS and the on-premises environment. This would result in higher operational overhead compared to a fully managed solution.<br>C. Amazon FSx for Lustre is designed for high-performance computing workloads, not for Windows home directories. It lacks native support for Windows-specific features like Active Directory integration and would require additional components to work with Windows environments, increasing operational overhead.<br>The combination of migrating home directories to FSx for Windows File Server and moving remote users to AWS Client VPN provides a comprehensive solution that addresses all the requirements with minimal operational overhead.

<br>The requirement is to minimize failover time for the website’s backend service (currently &gt;1 minute due to Route 53 TTL and health check delays). &nbsp;<br>Option D solves this by: &nbsp;<br>- Using CloudFront Origin Groups: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Configure two origins (primary and DR Region backends). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Enable origin failover in CloudFront (automatically switches to the secondary origin if the primary fails). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Failover happens in seconds (bypasses Route 53 TTL/health check delays). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Dual CloudFront distributions + Route 53 failover still relies on Route 53 health checks (TTL delays persist). &nbsp;<br>- B: 4-second TTL is impractical (violates AWS’s minimum TTL of 10 seconds for alias records). &nbsp;<br>- C: Latency routing doesn’t address failover (it routes based on latency, not health). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- CloudFront Origin Failover provides near-instant failover (vs. Route 53’s dependency on TTL/health checks). &nbsp;<br>- Eliminates dependency on DNS propagation (which causes delays in Route 53-based failover). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the requirement to centrally restrict access to some AWS services across multiple accounts while allowing access to services currently in use, the correct combination of steps is:<br>A. Use a Deny list strategy. B. Review the Access Advisor in AWS IAM to determine services recently used. E. Define organizational units (OUs) and place the member accounts in the OUs.<br>Here's why these three options are the correct choices:<br>Use a Deny list strategy (Option A):<br>A Deny list strategy is the most appropriate approach when you want to allow most services but restrict access to specific ones.<br>This aligns with the company's requirement to "allow access to services that are currently in-use and deny a few specific services."<br>With a Deny list strategy, you keep the default FullAWSAccess SCP in place and create additional SCPs that explicitly deny access to specific services.<br>This approach requires less maintenance as new AWS services are automatically allowed unless explicitly denied.<br>Review the Access Advisor in AWS IAM to determine services recently used (Option B):<br>IAM Access Advisor provides insights into which AWS services have been accessed by IAM entities (users, groups, and roles) and when they were last used.<br>This tool is perfect for identifying which services are currently in use across the organization, which is necessary to determine which services should remain accessible.<br>Access Advisor provides historical data (typically for the last 365 days), allowing the company to make informed decisions about which services to restrict.<br>Define organizational units (OUs) and place the member accounts in the OUs (Option E):<br>Organizing accounts into OUs allows the company to "administer multiple accounts together as a single unit" as required.<br>OUs provide a hierarchical structure for applying SCPs to groups of accounts with similar requirements.<br>This approach simplifies policy management and allows for more granular control over which restrictions apply to which groups of accounts.<br>OUs can be structured to align with the company's organizational structure (e.g., separating production and non-production workloads).<br>The other options are not appropriate for the given requirements:<br>C. Review the AWS Trusted Advisor report to determine services recently used - While Trusted Advisor provides useful insights, it's not specifically designed to show which services are being used across accounts. IAM Access Advisor is the more appropriate tool for this purpose.<br>D. Remove the default FullAWSAccess SCP - This would be appropriate for an Allow list strategy, not a Deny list strategy. Removing this SCP would deny access to all services by default, which contradicts the requirement to "allow access to services that are currently in-use."<br>The combination of using a Deny list strategy, reviewing IAM Access Advisor to determine which services are in use, and organizing accounts into OUs provides the most effective approach to meet the company's requirements for centrally restricting access to unused AWS services while maintaining access to necessary services.<br>Sources<br>Restrict access using AWS Organizations service control policies - AWS Account Management （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/using-orgs-example-scps.html）<br>Using AWS Organizations for security - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/organizations-security.html）<br>Community | Manage Security and Costs Across the Enterprise With AWS Organizations （https://community.aws/content/2iCmFQ2kf2EWfMXQUXZh6BJIyM7/practical-cloud-guide-manage-security-and-costs-across-the-enterprise-with-aws-organizations）<br>

<summary>Answer</summary>
<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>Option D is the correct answer. Using a scheduled scaling policy for EC2 instances allows for the pre-planning of resources for known high-traffic events. Amazon Aurora's ability to handle high transaction rates and its support for scaling individual replicas makes it a good choice for the database layer. The use of AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge for automating the scaling of Aurora Replicas before and after the sale events ensures that the database can handle the load while keeping costs in check during off-peak times.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Handle high, predictable traffic peaks (one-time scheduled sale events). &nbsp;<br>2. Maximize availability for both compute (EC2) and database (PostgreSQL) layers. &nbsp;<br>Option D meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Scheduled scaling for EC2: Proactively scales out before the event (predictive scaling is less precise for one-time events). &nbsp;<br>- Aurora PostgreSQL Multi-AZ: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Scaling read replicas: Lambda automates replica scaling before/after the event. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Failover to larger replicas: Ensures database performance during peak loads. &nbsp;<br>- EventBridge rules: Trigger Lambda functions to manage scaling dynamically. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A & C: Predictive scaling is better for recurring patterns (not one-time events). Pre-warming databases is unnecessary with Aurora’s auto-scaling. &nbsp;<br>- B: RDS PostgreSQL read replicas require manual promotion (Aurora’s failover is faster and more reliable). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Scheduled scaling is ideal for known traffic spikes (e.g., ticket sales). &nbsp;<br>- Aurora Multi-AZ + read replicas provides high availability and scalable performance. &nbsp;<br>- EventBridge + Lambda automates scaling workflows. &nbsp;<br>

<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Improve upload performance for large files (&gt;100 MB). &nbsp;<br>2. Ensure only authenticated users can upload (presigned URLs already enforce this). &nbsp;<br>Option C meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration → Uses CloudFront’s edge network for faster uploads globally. &nbsp;<br>- Using multipart upload API → Parallelizes large file uploads (improves speed and reliability). &nbsp;<br>- Retaining presigned URLs → Maintains authentication without added complexity. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A & B: API Gateway as an S3 proxy adds latency and complexity (no performance gain over direct S3 uploads). &nbsp;<br>- D: CloudFront with PUT/POST is not optimized for uploads (Transfer Acceleration is purpose-built for S3). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- S3 Transfer Acceleration leverages CloudFront’s backbone for faster uploads. &nbsp;<br>- Multipart uploads split large files into parts (improves throughput). &nbsp;<br>- Presigned URLs remain the simplest way to authenticate uploads. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. By setting up two SQS queues, with the primary queue handling incoming data and the secondary queue acting as a dead-letter queue, the architect can ensure that data is not lost when the Lambda function is unable to process it due to the third-party service failure. This setup allows for the data to be reprocessed at a later time, thus improving the resiliency of the system.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Ensure no data is lost (handle third-party service failures). &nbsp;<br>2. Enable delayed processing (retry failed jobs). &nbsp;<br>Option B meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using two SQS queues: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Primary queue: Buffers incoming weather data (decouples API Gateway from Lambda). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Dead-letter queue (DLQ): Captures failed processing attempts (ensures no data loss). &nbsp;<br>- Lambda retries: Processes messages from the primary queue; failed messages move to the DLQ for later reprocessing. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Single SQS queue as DLQ for API Gateway is invalid (API Gateway cannot directly use SQS as DLQ). &nbsp;<br>- C & D: EventBridge lacks built-in retry logic (SQS is better for queuing and reprocessing). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- SQS + DLQ is the standard for resilient message processing. &nbsp;<br>- Decoupling (API Gateway → SQS → Lambda) prevents data loss during third-party failures. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option A is correct as publishing slow query and error logs to CloudWatch Logs can help in identifying and diagnosing database performance issues. Option B is correct because implementing AWS X-Ray can provide insights into the performance of the application and its underlying services, including the ability to trace SQL queries.

Tracing request flows (identify bottlenecks). &nbsp;<br>Options A, B, and D meet these needs by: &nbsp;<br>- A: Aurora slow query/error logs in CloudWatch → Diagnose DB performance issues. &nbsp;<br>- B: AWS X-Ray → Trace HTTP requests and SQL queries end-to-end. &nbsp;<br>- D: CloudWatch Logs agent → Persist Apache logs (survives instance termination). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- C: Kinesis for Aurora logs is overkill (CloudWatch Logs suffices). &nbsp;<br>- E: CloudTrail tracks API calls, not application performance. &nbsp;<br>- F: X-Ray doesn’t benchmark Aurora (it traces requests, unlike Performance Insights). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- CloudWatch Logs centralizes logs for Auto Scaling workloads. &nbsp;<br>- X-Ray maps distributed transaction flows. &nbsp;<br>- Aurora logs in CloudWatch enable historical query analysis. &nbsp;<br>

<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Prevent developers from managing other teams’ EC2 instances (isolate workloads by development unit). &nbsp;<br>2. Allow developers to manage their own instances (least privilege). &nbsp;<br>Option B meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using SAML + STS session tags: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Pass a `DevelopmentUnit` tag during federation (e.g., `TeamA`, `TeamB`). &nbsp;<br>- IAM policy with `StringNotEquals` condition: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Denies actions if the `aws:PrincipalTag/DevelopmentUnit` (user’s team) doesn’t match the `DevelopmentUnit` tag on the EC2 instance. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: SCPs with `StringNotEquals` are overly broad (SCPs apply to entire OUs, not fine-grained resources). &nbsp;<br>- C: SCPs with `allow` + `StringEquals` would block all untagged resources (risky for production). &nbsp;<br>- D: Static IAM policies per team are hard to scale (STS session tags dynamically enforce isolation). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- STS session tags enable dynamic, attribute-based access control (ABAC). &nbsp;<br>- IAM conditions (`aws:PrincipalTag`) enforce team-based isolation without manual policy updates. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option B is correct as it allows the creation of standardized infrastructure services using AWS CloudFormation templates within AWS Service Catalog, which can be shared across the organization. Option D is correct as it enables the enforcement of least privilege access by restricting user IAM roles to ServiceCatalogEndUserAccess permissions and using automation to manage access and apply launch constraints. Option E is correct as it allows for the enforcement of tagging by using the AWS Service Catalog TagOption Library, ensuring that all infrastructure provisioned through Service Catalog will have the required tags.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Least privilege access (users can only launch approved services). &nbsp;<br>2. Central management (templates in a central account). &nbsp;<br>3. Multi-account distribution (via AWS Organizations). &nbsp;<br>4. Tag enforcement (mandatory tags on resources). &nbsp;<br>Options B, E, and D meet these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- B: Service Catalog in a central account → CloudFormation templates are shared as products/portfolios across accounts. &nbsp;<br>- E: TagOption Library → Enforces consistent tags across all provisioned resources. &nbsp;<br>- D: Restrict users to `ServiceCatalogEndUserAccess` → Limits users to launching only approved Service Catalog products. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: S3 + CloudFormation lacks governance (no approval workflow or tag enforcement). &nbsp;<br>- C: SCP to deny all except CloudFormation/S3 is too permissive (users can still deploy unapproved templates). &nbsp;<br>- F: CloudFormation Resource Tags are manual (Service Catalog automates enforcement). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Service Catalog centralizes approved infrastructure as code (IaC). &nbsp;<br>- TagOptions ensure compliance with tagging policies. &nbsp;<br>- Least privilege is achieved via `ServiceCatalogEndUserAccess`. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the requirement to prevent increasing query times for AWS WAF logs in Amazon Athena while minimizing operational overhead, the best solution is:<br>D. Modify the Kinesis Data Firehose configuration and Athena table definition to partition the data by date and time. Change the Athena query to view the relevant partitions.<br>Here's why this is the optimal solution:<br>Root Cause of Increasing Query Times: The query time is increasing because Athena is scanning an ever-growing amount of data in S3. Without partitioning, Athena must scan all WAF logs, even though the query only needs the last 24 hours of data.<br>Benefits of Partitioning:<br>Query Performance: Partitioning by date and time allows Athena to scan only the relevant partitions (last 24 hours) instead of the entire dataset, dramatically improving query performance.<br>Consistent Performance Over Time: As the total data volume grows, query performance remains stable because Athena only scans the partitions specified in the query.<br>Cost Efficiency: Athena pricing is based on the amount of data scanned, so partitioning reduces costs by limiting the scan to relevant data.<br>Implementation with Minimal Operational Overhead:<br>Kinesis Data Firehose can be configured to automatically partition data by date and time using dynamic prefixes like year=!{timestamp:yyyy}/month=!{timestamp:MM}/day=!{timestamp:dd}/hour=!{timestamp:HH}/<br>Athena's partition projection feature automatically manages partitions without manual intervention<br>Once configured, this solution runs automatically without daily maintenance<br>Why Option A is Less Optimal: Creating a Lambda function to consolidate daily logs would:<br>Introduce additional complexity and a potential point of failure<br>Require ongoing maintenance of the Lambda function<br>Not address the fundamental issue of scanning unnecessary data<br>Increase operational overhead rather than minimize it<br>The partitioning solution is a one-time configuration change that provides an automated, scalable approach to maintaining query performance as data volume grows. By modifying the Kinesis Data Firehose configuration to partition data and updating the Athena table definition to recognize these partitions, the company can ensure that queries only scan relevant data, keeping query times consistent regardless of how much historical data accumulates in S3.<br>Sources<br>Example queries for AWS WAF logs - Amazon Athena （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/query-examples-waf-logs.html）<br>How to use Amazon Athena queries to analyze AWS WAF logs and provide the visibility needed for threat detection | Networking & Content Delivery （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/how-to-use-amazon-athena-queries-to-analyze-aws-waf-logs-and-provide-the-visibility-needed-for-threat-detection/）<br>Amazon Data Firehose example - Amazon Athena （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/partition-projection-kinesis-firehose-example.html）<br>

<br>Option C is the correct solution as it meets the requirement of not allowing data to travel across the public internet by using VPC peering and AWS PrivateLink for a secure and private connection between the primary and DR Regions. Additionally, by using AWS DataSync, the company can efficiently copy data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system in the DR Region, ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery preparedness. This solution leverages AWS managed services and maintains compliance with the company's data travel restrictions.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate a legacy Windows file server to FSx for Windows (AWS managed service). &nbsp;<br>2. Replicate data to another Region for DR (no public internet traffic). &nbsp;<br>3. Compliance: Data must not traverse the public internet. &nbsp;<br>Option C meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using FSx for Windows in both Regions → Fully managed, compatible with Windows file servers. &nbsp;<br>- VPC peering + PrivateLink → Ensures private replication (no internet exposure). &nbsp;<br>- AWS DataSync → Efficient, secure cross-Region file synchronization (supports PrivateLink). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: FSx File Gateway + S3 is for hybrid storage (not cross-Region DR for FSx). S3 is not a direct replacement for FSx. &nbsp;<br>- B: Site-to-Site VPN works but is less scalable than VPC peering/PrivateLink. &nbsp;<br>- D: Transfer Family is for SFTP/FTP (not designed for FSx replication). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- FSx for Windows supports native Windows features (SMB, Active Directory integration). &nbsp;<br>- DataSync + PrivateLink ensures encrypted, low-latency replication over AWS backbone. &nbsp;<br>- VPC peering simplifies private connectivity between Regions. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided about creating IAM users in a new member account within AWS Organizations, the correct approach is:<br>B. From the management account, switch roles to assume the OrganizationAccountAccessRole role with the account ID of the new member account. Set up the IAM users as required.<br>Here's why this is the correct approach:<br>Automatic Role Creation: When a new member account is created in AWS Organizations, an IAM role called OrganizationAccountAccessRole is automatically created in that account. This role is specifically designed to provide administrative access from the management account.<br>Administrative Permissions: The OrganizationAccountAccessRole has full administrative permissions (via the AdministratorAccess policy) in the member account, which allows for creating IAM users and performing any other necessary account setup tasks.<br>Security Best Practice: Using the OrganizationAccountAccessRole follows AWS security best practices by avoiding the use of root user credentials. AWS recommends minimizing the use of root credentials and instead using IAM roles for administrative tasks.<br>Centralized Management: This approach leverages the centralized management capabilities of AWS Organizations, allowing administrators to manage multiple accounts from the management account without needing separate credentials for each account.<br>Process: The solutions architect would:<br>Sign in to the AWS Management Console using their IAM user (Support1) credentials in the management account<br>Click on their account name in the top right corner and select "Switch Role"<br>Enter the new member account ID and the role name "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"<br>After switching roles, they would have administrative access to create IAM users in the new member account<br>Option A (using root user credentials) is not recommended because:<br>It requires accessing and using the root user of the member account, which is against AWS security best practices<br>Root user access should be reserved for only a few specific tasks that cannot be performed by IAM users or roles<br>Using root credentials increases security risks and makes it harder to track and audit administrative actions<br>The OrganizationAccountAccessRole provides a secure, auditable, and centralized way to manage member accounts within AWS Organizations, making Option B the correct approach for creating IAM users in the new member account.<br>Sources<br>Add initial users - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts/add-initial-users.html）<br>Accessing a member account that has OrganizationAccountAccessRole with AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access-cross-account-role.html）<br>Secure root user access for member accounts in AWS Organizations | AWS Security Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/security/secure-root-user-access-for-member-accounts-in-aws-organizations/）<br>

<br>Correct Answer: B &nbsp;<br>Option B: Implement an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cache to store database query results and modify Lambda functions to use the cache. &nbsp;<br> Explanation: &nbsp;<br> Key Requirements Analysis &nbsp;<br>- Problem: Repeated database queries lead to memory errors due to traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br>- Goal: Reduce database load without restricting functionality or incurring high costs. &nbsp;<br><br><br> Option Analysis &nbsp;<br>1. Option B (Correct) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Strategy: Use ElastiCache for Redis as an in-memory cache to store query results. Lambda functions first check the cache before accessing the database. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Advantages: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Addresses root cause: Caches frequent queries to minimize redundant database calls, reducing memory pressure. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Cost-efficient: ElastiCache scales dynamically and reduces database compute usage during spikes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Performance improvement: Cache responses are faster than database queries, enhancing user experience. &nbsp;<br>2. Option A (Incorrect) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Issue: Converting to an edge-optimized API Gateway endpoint reduces latency for global users but does not address repeated queries. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Limitation: API Gateway caching (up to 1 MB) is less effective for complex database results and requires per-route configuration, making it less suitable for deep query caching. &nbsp;<br>3. Option C (Incorrect) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Flaw: Increasing Aurora Serverless memory directly raises costs without resolving redundant queries. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Trade-off: This is a reactive solution that does not optimize resource utilization for repetitive requests. &nbsp;<br>4. Option D (Incorrect) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Problem: Enabling API Gateway throttling limits incoming requests, which may disrupt partner apps and restrict legitimate traffic growth. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Mismatch: Throttling addresses volume but not the underlying issue of redundant queries. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion &nbsp;<br>Option B optimizes performance by caching query results, reducing database load and memory pressure while maintaining cost efficiency. This approach directly targets the root cause of repeated queries without compromising functionality or incurring unnecessary expenses.<br>

<br>Option B is the correct solution for migrating the data with the least possible downtime while meeting the encryption requirements. AWS DMS supports the migration of large databases like the one described (5 TB) and can perform the migration over the Direct Connect connection, which ensures that the data does not travel over the public internet. By using CDC, the migration can be done with minimal downtime as only the initial full load is required to be complete, followed by the ongoing replication of changes. Additionally, AWS DMS can integrate with VPC endpoints for a secure and private connection, and the use of AWS KMS for encryption at rest aligns with the requirement for data encryption.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate a 5 TB MySQL database to AWS without internet exposure (use Direct Connect). &nbsp;<br>2. Encrypt data in transit and at rest (TLS + KMS). &nbsp;<br>3. Minimize downtime (near-zero RPO/RTO). &nbsp;<br>Option B meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using AWS DMS with Direct Connect private VIF: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Full load + CDC replicates existing data and ongoing changes with minimal downtime. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Private subnet + VPC endpoints ensure no internet exposure. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- TLS encryption for in-transit data + AWS KMS for at-rest encryption. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A & C: Snowball/DataSync + S3 requires manual import steps (downtime during restore). &nbsp;<br>- D: S3 File Gateway is for file storage (not optimal for database migration). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- DMS with CDC is the gold standard for minimal-downtime database migrations. &nbsp;<br>- Direct Connect private VIF provides secure, high-throughput connectivity. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option D is the correct approach to meet the specified RTO and RPO requirements for disaster recovery. By changing the Aurora Serverless v1 database to a standard Aurora MySQL global database, the company can leverage Aurora's global database feature to replicate data across Regions. This setup allows for a fast failover to the target Region while ensuring that the data is replicated in near real-time, which aligns with the 1-minute RPO. Additionally, launching the solution in the target Region and configuring it to work in an active-passive configuration helps meet the 5-minute RTO. This configuration ensures that in the event of a disaster, the application can quickly switch over to the secondary Region with minimal downtime.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Disaster Recovery (DR) with RTO ≤5 min and RPO ≤1 min (near-zero data loss). &nbsp;<br>2. Multi-Region resilience for a serverless SaaS application. &nbsp;<br>Option D meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Using Aurora Global Database: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Cross-Region replication with &lt;1s latency (meets RPO). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- 1-click promotion of secondary Region (meets RTO). &nbsp;<br>- Active-Passive deployment: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Pre-deployed infrastructure in DR Region (API Gateway + Lambda). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Fast failover by promoting the secondary Aurora cluster. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Aurora Serverless v1 read replicas cannot be promoted (no DR capability). &nbsp;<br>- B: Global Database + runbook lacks pre-deployed compute (violates RTO). &nbsp;<br>- C: Aurora Serverless v1 doesn’t support multi-writer (invalid configuration). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- Aurora Global Database is the only serverless-compatible solution for sub-minute RPO. &nbsp;<br>- Pre-deployed serverless components (Lambda/API Gateway) ensure 5-minute RTO. <br>

<br>Option A is the correct solution to ensure high availability and the ability to handle increased load during content updates. By setting up DAX as an in-memory cache, the application can significantly reduce the latency of read operations on DynamoDB, which is crucial during peak load times. The use of an Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances ensures that the compute resources can scale out to meet demand, and an ALB can distribute the incoming traffic across these instances. Additionally, updating the Route 53 record to target the ALB's DNS alias allows for smooth traffic routing, and configuring scheduled scaling can proactively increase the EC2 capacity before anticipated content updates, thus preventing downtime.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Handle high load during quarterly content updates (predictable spikes). &nbsp;<br>2. Maintain high availability (eliminate downtime). &nbsp;<br>3. Replace self-hosted Redis with a managed solution. &nbsp;<br>Option A meets these requirements by: &nbsp;<br>- Replacing Redis with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Fully managed, in-memory cache for DynamoDB (reduces database load). &nbsp;<br>- Auto Scaling + ALB: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Scales EC2 instances horizontally during traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Distributes traffic evenly across instances. &nbsp;<br>- Scheduled scaling: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Proactively scales before content updates (avoids reactive scaling delays). &nbsp;<br>- Route 53 simple routing: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Directs traffic to the ALB (simpler than multivalue routing). &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B: CloudFront is unnecessary (content updates are backend-driven, not static). Manual scaling is less reliable than scheduled scaling. &nbsp;<br>- C: Memcached lacks persistence (not ideal for travel data caching). &nbsp;<br>- D: CloudFront + DAX is mismatched (CloudFront caches static content, not DynamoDB queries). &nbsp;<br> Best Practices: &nbsp;<br>- DAX reduces DynamoDB read latency by 10x (ideal for high-read workloads). &nbsp;<br>- Scheduled scaling ensures capacity is ready before traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the requirement to store and process image data uploaded from mobile devices with high peak usage during business hours, the best combination of actions to ensure scalable image processing is:<br>B. Upload files from the mobile software directly to Amazon S3. Use S3 event notifications to create a message in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue.<br>C. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to perform image processing when a message is available in the queue.<br>E. Send a push notification to the mobile app by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) when processing is complete.<br>Here's why this combination provides the optimal solution:<br>Direct S3 Uploads (Option B):<br>Allows mobile devices to upload images directly to S3 without requiring an intermediary server<br>S3 can handle thousands of concurrent uploads per minute, easily meeting the peak demand<br>S3 event notifications automatically trigger the next step in the workflow when new files are uploaded<br>SQS standard queue provides a buffer between uploads and processing, absorbing traffic spikes<br>This decoupling ensures the system remains responsive even during peak upload times<br>Lambda for Processing (Option C):<br>Lambda functions automatically scale to process messages from the SQS queue<br>Lambda's serverless nature means you only pay for actual processing time, ideal for the variable workload described (busy during business hours, minimal usage otherwise)<br>Lambda can be configured to process multiple images concurrently, handling the high volume during peak times<br>The queue-based approach ensures no uploads are lost even if processing temporarily falls behind<br>SNS Push Notifications (Option E):<br>After processing is complete, SNS can send push notifications directly to the mobile app<br>This satisfies the requirement that "A user is notified when image processing is complete"<br>SNS is highly scalable and can handle thousands of notifications per minute<br>This architecture creates a fully serverless, event-driven pipeline that:<br>Scales automatically to handle the variable load (thousands of uploads during business hours, minimal usage otherwise)<br>Decouples each step of the process for better resilience<br>Provides end-to-end notification when processing is complete<br>Minimizes costs by only using resources when needed (pay-per-use model)<br>Requires minimal operational overhead<br>The combination of S3 for storage, SQS for buffering, Lambda for processing, and SNS for notifications creates a robust, scalable solution that perfectly addresses the requirements for this image processing workflow.<br>Sources<br>What is the recommended convention for storing images in a serverless event-driven architecture?

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Deploy an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Configure the S3 File Gateway to use Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) for the metadata files and image files.<br>This solution meets all the requirements for the following reasons:<br>SMB Protocol Access: S3 File Gateway supports the SMB protocol, allowing the company to access the data using the same protocol they currently use in their data center. This ensures compatibility with their existing application.<br>Availability within 5 minutes: S3 Standard-IA provides millisecond retrieval times, easily meeting the requirement that data must be available within 5 minutes. This storage class is designed for data that is accessed infrequently but requires rapid access when needed.<br>Cost Optimization: Since the copy of the data is "rarely accessed," using S3 Standard-IA is cost-effective as it offers a lower storage cost compared to S3 Standard while still maintaining rapid retrieval capabilities.<br>Disaster Recovery: This solution enables the company to access their data from either the data center or AWS in the event of a disaster, providing the flexibility needed for their DR strategy.<br>Option C (using S3 Glacier Deep Archive for image files) would not meet the requirements because:<br>S3 Glacier Deep Archive has a retrieval time of 12+ hours, which far exceeds the 5-minute availability requirement specified by the company.<br>S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-term archival of data that may be accessed once or twice a year, not for disaster recovery scenarios where data needs to be quickly accessible.<br>S3 File Gateway does not support direct access to S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class. Files stored in Glacier Deep Archive would need to be restored to S3 before they could be accessed through the gateway, adding complexity and delays to the recovery process.<br>By using S3 Standard-IA for both metadata files and image files, the company ensures that all their data is readily available within the required timeframe while still optimizing costs for infrequently accessed data.

<br>Option C is the correct solution. Amazon WorkSpaces provides a cloud-based desktop service that can be integrated with an on-premises Active Directory through an AD Connector. This allows employees to use their existing identity credentials. By setting up a VPN connection, the company can ensure a secure connection to the on-premises network. Configuring a RADIUS server for MFA adds an additional layer of security and meets the requirement for multifactor authentication, thus replicating a secure user experience from the existing desktops.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Support for both Windows and Linux desktops → Amazon WorkSpaces supports both, while AppStream 2.0 is primarily for application streaming (not full desktops). &nbsp;<br>2. Integration with on-premises Active Directory → AD Connector allows WorkSpaces to authenticate against on-premises AD. &nbsp;<br>3. Multifactor Authentication (MFA) → WorkSpaces can integrate with a RADIUS server (e.g., AWS MFA or third-party MFA solutions). &nbsp;<br>4. Replicate the existing user experience → WorkSpaces provides full virtual desktops, matching the employees' current setup. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Incorrect because MFA for WorkSpaces via the AWS Management Console is not the best practice; a RADIUS server is preferred for on-prem AD integration. &nbsp;<br>- B: Incorrect because AppStream 2.0 does not provide full desktop replication (only application streaming). &nbsp;<br>- D: Incorrect because AppStream 2.0 does not fully replicate the desktop experience and is not ideal for mixed OS environments. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>C is the best solution as it meets all requirements by leveraging Amazon WorkSpaces with AD Connector and RADIUS-based MFA. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Stream the data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Create an AWS Lambda function to consume the Kinesis data stream and to analyze the data. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to notify the operations team.<br>This solution meets the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Real-time processing: The company needs to analyze the data in real time and send immediate notifications when parameters fall out of acceptable ranges. Kinesis Data Streams provides true real-time processing with sub-second latency, which is essential for monitoring critical factory environmental parameters.<br>Immediate analysis: Lambda functions can be triggered by new records in a Kinesis data stream, allowing for immediate analysis of the incoming sensor data. Lambda can execute custom code to check if humidity, light, or other parameters are outside acceptable ranges.<br>Immediate notifications: When Lambda detects out-of-range parameters, it can immediately trigger Amazon SNS to send notifications to the factory operations team. This ensures the team is alerted without delay, as required.<br>Scalability: This architecture can easily scale to handle data from multiple factories and thousands of sensors, automatically adjusting to varying data volumes.<br>Option A (using Kinesis Data Firehose with Step Functions) is less suitable because:<br>Kinesis Data Firehose is designed primarily for data delivery to destinations like S3, Redshift, or Elasticsearch, not for real-time analysis. It typically has a minimum delivery time of 60 seconds, which doesn't meet the requirement for immediate notifications.<br>AWS Step Functions is an orchestration service designed for complex workflows, not for continuous real-time data processing. It would introduce unnecessary complexity and potential delays in the notification process.<br>This architecture would likely result in higher latency between when a parameter falls out of range and when the operations team receives a notification.<br>The combination of Kinesis Data Streams, Lambda, and SNS creates a streamlined, event-driven architecture that can process sensor data in real time, analyze it immediately, and send notifications without delay when issues are detected. This makes it the optimal solution for the company's requirements of real-time analysis and immediate notifications.<br>Sources<br>Unlocking Scalable IoT Analytics on AWS | The Internet of Things on AWS – Official Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/iot/unlocking-scalable-iot-analytics-on-aws/）<br>Data processing - Data Warehousing on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-warehousing-on-aws/data-processing.html）<br>Step 1: Redirect ongoing data ingestion - AWS IoT Analytics （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/redirect-ongoing-data.html）<br>Messaging and streaming layer - Serverless Applications Lens （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/messaging-and-streaming-layer.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Configure the workload to use topology spread constraints that are based on Availability Zone.<br>This solution will maximize node resilience for the Amazon EKS cluster for the following reasons:<br>High Availability Across Multiple Zones: Topology spread constraints allow you to distribute pods evenly across different Availability Zones (AZs). This ensures that if an entire AZ experiences an outage or degradation, your application will continue to run in other AZs with minimal impact.<br>Fault Isolation: By spreading pods across multiple AZs, you create natural fault boundaries. This means that infrastructure failures in one zone won't affect the entire workload, significantly improving overall resilience.<br>Balanced Resource Utilization: Topology spread constraints help the Kubernetes scheduler make intelligent decisions about pod placement, ensuring that resources are utilized evenly across the cluster. This prevents overloading specific nodes or zones.<br>Compatibility with Autoscaling: This approach works well with the unpredictable scaling requirements mentioned in the scenario. As new pods are created during rapid scaling events, they will be distributed according to the topology constraints, maintaining resilience even during dynamic scaling.<br>Stateless Workload Advantage: Since the pods are stateless, they can be easily redistributed across zones without concerns about data persistence, making topology spread constraints particularly effective.<br>Let's examine why the other options are less effective:<br>Option A (separate launch template for EKS control plane in a second cluster) doesn't directly address node resilience for the workload. The EKS control plane is already managed by AWS across multiple AZs, so this approach adds unnecessary complexity without improving workload resilience.<br>Option B (smaller number of node groups with larger instances) could actually reduce resilience by creating fewer points of failure. If a large instance fails, it would affect more pods than if the same workload were spread across more numerous, smaller instances.<br>Option C (configuring Cluster Autoscaler to keep compute capacity underprovisioned) would likely lead to resource shortages during rapid scaling events, potentially causing pod scheduling delays or failures. Underprovisioning works against resilience by limiting available resources when they're needed most.<br>Topology spread constraints based on Availability Zone provide the most effective way to maximize node resilience for this unpredictable, rapidly scaling stateless workload by ensuring pods are distributed across multiple failure domains.<br>Sources<br>Scaling - Containers on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/containers-on-aws/scaling.html）<br>Running highly-available applications - Amazon EKS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/application.html）<br>EKS Data Plane - Amazon EKS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/data-plane.html）<br>

<br>Option C is the solution that will meet the requirements for a disaster recovery plan with minimal recovery time. By setting up a second ECS cluster and ECS service on Fargate in a separate Region, the company can ensure that the application can be quickly switched over to the backup Region in the event of a failure. Creating a cross-Region read replica of the RDS DB instance allows for data redundancy and the ability to promote the read replica to primary quickly, minimizing data loss. Additionally, configuring an AWS Lambda function to update Route 53 ensures that traffic is automatically routed to the healthy ECS cluster, reducing downtime.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Disaster Recovery (DR) in a separate Region → Need a standby setup in another AWS Region. &nbsp;<br>2. Minimize recovery time (RTO) → Using a cross-Region RDS read replica allows faster promotion to primary compared to snapshot-based recovery. &nbsp;<br>3. Microservices on ECS Fargate → A pre-configured ECS cluster in the DR Region ensures quick failover. &nbsp;<br>4. Automated DNS failover with Route 53 → Lambda can update DNS to redirect traffic to the DR Region. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Cross-Region RDS Read Replica: Enables near-instant promotion to primary (much faster than snapshot restores). &nbsp;<br>- Pre-Provisioned ECS Cluster: Eliminates deployment delays during failover. &nbsp;<br>- Automated Lambda Failover: Triggered by EventBridge, updates Route 53 for seamless traffic redirection. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A & B: Rely on snapshot-based recovery, which is slower than promoting a read replica. &nbsp;<br>- D: Incorrectly suggests converting RDS MySQL to DynamoDB (not a valid DR strategy for relational data). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>C is the most efficient solution, leveraging cross-Region RDS read replicas and pre-deployed ECS for minimal downtime. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Receive the orders in an Amazon SQS queue and invoke an AWS Lambda function to process them.<br>This approach is the MOST reliable solution for meeting the e-commerce company's requirements for the following reasons:<br>High Availability: Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that provides high availability by default. It stores messages across multiple servers and data centers, ensuring that orders are not lost even if some AWS infrastructure components fail.<br>Loose Coupling: Using SQS creates a buffer between the components that receive orders and those that process them. This decoupling is essential for building resilient systems where failures in one component don't affect others.<br>Scalability for Sporadic Traffic: The SQS queue can handle varying loads of incoming orders without any configuration changes. During marketing campaigns when order volume spikes, the queue will simply accumulate messages without any performance degradation.<br>Automatic Scaling: AWS Lambda functions automatically scale based on the number of messages in the SQS queue. As more orders come in, more Lambda function instances are automatically created to process them, without any manual intervention or pre-provisioning.<br>Cost Efficiency: With this serverless approach, the company only pays for actual usage. During periods of low activity, costs are minimal, and during high-traffic marketing campaigns, resources scale up as needed.<br>Minimal Delays: The combination of SQS and Lambda ensures that orders are processed with minimal delays, even during traffic spikes. Lambda functions can be configured to process multiple messages in parallel.<br>Simplified Operations: This architecture eliminates the need to manage servers, databases, or scaling policies, reducing operational complexity.<br>Option A (using EC2 instances and an EC2-hosted database) is less reliable because:<br>It requires manual scaling or complex auto-scaling configurations to handle sporadic traffic patterns.<br>The EC2-hosted database could become a bottleneck during high-traffic periods.<br>It introduces more potential points of failure with multiple EC2 instances and a self-managed database.<br>It requires more operational overhead to ensure high availability.<br>It's not as cost-effective for sporadic workloads since EC2 instances would need to be running even during low-traffic periods.<br>The SQS and Lambda approach provides a simple, highly available, loosely coupled, and automatically scaling solution that meets all the requirements specified by the company's CIO, making it the most reliable choice for this e-commerce order processing application.<br>Sources<br>Scaling and event processing with SNS and SQS | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUcnYW9ZAkSA-Px9tyHm_sYw/scaling-and-event-processing-with-sns-and-sqs）<br>Amazon SQS FIFO queue and Lambda concurrency behavior - Amazon Simple Queue Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/fifo-queue-lambda-behavior.html）<br>Building resilient applications: design patterns for handling database outages | AWS Database Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/building-resilient-applications-design-patterns-for-handling-database-outages/）<br>

<br>Option B is the correct solution to meet the requirements of not exposing credentials within application code and automating password rotation. AWS Secrets Manager is designed to securely store, manage, and rotate database credentials, along with other types of secrets. By storing the credentials in Secrets Manager with distinct key entries for each environment (QA and production), the company ensures that sensitive information is not hard-coded in the application code. The rotation feature of Secrets Manager allows for automatic password rotation, which enhances security by regularly updating credentials. Providing a reference to the Secrets Manager key as an environment variable for the Lambda functions enables the Lambda functions to access the credentials without including them in the code.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. No credentials in application code → Secrets must be stored externally. &nbsp;<br>2. Automatic password rotation → Requires a service that supports rotation. &nbsp;<br>3. Environment separation (QA & Production) → Must manage credentials per environment securely. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- AWS Secrets Manager: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Securely stores credentials (encrypted at rest). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Supports automatic rotation (key requirement). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Allows environment separation (distinct keys for QA/prod). &nbsp;<br>- Lambda Integration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Secrets can be referenced via environment variables (no hardcoding). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- IAM roles grant Lambda access to Secrets Manager. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Parameter Store): Does not support automatic rotation (only Secrets Manager does). &nbsp;<br>- C (AWS KMS): KMS encrypts but does not store or rotate secrets. &nbsp;<br>- D (S3): Not secure for credential storage (S3 is not designed for secrets management). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the only solution that meets all requirements (secure storage, rotation, and environment separation). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Create an SCP that prevents the launch of instances that have a public IP address. Additionally, configure the SCP to prevent the attachment of a public IP address to existing instances. Attach the SCP to the OU.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Comprehensive Prevention: Service Control Policies (SCPs) act as permission guardrails that apply to all accounts within an OU. By creating an SCP that specifically prevents both the launch of instances with public IP addresses and the attachment of public IPs to existing instances, the company ensures complete coverage of the requirement.<br>Preventative Control: SCPs work as preventative controls that deny actions before they can occur, rather than detecting and remediating after the fact. This ensures that no EC2 instance in the affected accounts can ever gain a public IP address.<br>Organization-Wide Enforcement: By attaching the SCP to the OU, the policy automatically applies to all accounts within that OU, including any new accounts that might be added in the future, providing consistent enforcement.<br>No Operational Overhead: Once implemented, the SCP requires no ongoing maintenance or monitoring to continue enforcing the policy.<br>Option A (using Systems Manager Automation runbooks) is less effective because:<br>It's a reactive approach that would need to continuously monitor and remediate instances<br>It requires all instances to have Systems Manager agents installed and properly configured<br>It introduces operational complexity and potential points of failure<br>It might not prevent the initial assignment of public IPs during instance launch<br>Option B (implementing AWS Control Tower proactive controls) is incorrect because:<br>AWS Control Tower proactive controls (also known as preventive guardrails) don't have a specific built-in control for the "AssociatePublicIpAddress" property<br>Proactive controls in Control Tower are typically implemented using SCPs or AWS CloudFormation hooks, not as a direct property setting<br>This approach as described wouldn't address existing instances that might already have public IPs or prevent other methods of attaching public IPs<br>The SCP approach (Option C) provides the most comprehensive, preventative, and low-maintenance solution to ensure that no EC2 instances in the OU's accounts can gain public IP addresses, making it the correct answer.<br>Sources<br>ec2-instance-no-public-ip - AWS Config （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-instance-no-public-ip.html）<br>Data residency controls with detective behavior - AWS Control Tower （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/controlreference/data-residency-detective-controls.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Create a user pool in Amazon Cognito. Configure the pool for the application. Populate the pool with the required users. Configure the pool to require MFA. Configure a listener rule on the ALB to require authentication through the Amazon Cognito hosted UI.<br>This solution meets all the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Restricted Access: By creating a user pool in Amazon Cognito and populating it with only the specific list of users who should have access, the company can control exactly who can access the application.<br>No Application Changes: This approach doesn't require any modifications to the third-party web application itself. The authentication happens at the ALB level, before traffic even reaches the application running in the Fargate containers.<br>No Identity Provider Integration: The solution doesn't require integrating the application with an identity provider. Instead, it leverages Amazon Cognito's hosted UI for authentication, which sits in front of the application.<br>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Amazon Cognito supports MFA, and the solution specifically mentions configuring the user pool to require MFA, satisfying this security requirement.<br>Internet Access: The solution maintains the ability for authorized users to access the application from the internet while preventing unauthorized access.<br>Works with Containerized Applications: This approach is compatible with the Docker image running as a Fargate service in Amazon ECS.<br>The implementation works as follows:<br>When a user attempts to access the application, the ALB listener rule intercepts the request.<br>The ALB redirects the user to the Amazon Cognito hosted UI for authentication.<br>The user provides their credentials and completes the MFA challenge.<br>Upon successful authentication, Amazon Cognito redirects the user back to the ALB with authentication information.<br>The ALB validates the authentication and forwards the request to the Fargate service running the application.<br>Users not in the Cognito user pool cannot authenticate and therefore cannot access the application.<br>This solution provides a secure authentication layer in front of the application without requiring any changes to the application itself, making it the correct answer for the given requirements.<br>Sources<br>ECS Task with public ip connect permanent | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUYfik8-3vSqO8fLIq2Z4GeQ/ecs-task-with-public-ip-connect-permanent）<br>Customer identity management - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/customer-identity-management.html）<br>Control Access to Web Applications and Mobile Apps - Navigating GDPR Compliance on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/navigating-gdpr-compliance/control-access-to-web-applications-and-mobile-apps.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer. Amazon RDS Proxy can be used to manage database connections efficiently, especially when dealing with numerous short-lived connections from AWS Lambda functions. By configuring a read-only endpoint for the proxy, the Lambda function can connect to the Aurora replica instances through the proxy, which will help manage the connection pool and reduce the number of concurrent connections to the database.<br>The problem stems from too many short-lived connections from Lambda to Aurora PostgreSQL replicas during high traffic, overwhelming the database. &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Amazon RDS Proxy is designed to manage connection pooling, reducing the overhead of frequent connections. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It sits between the Lambda function and the Aurora cluster, reusing connections efficiently. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The read-only endpoint ensures read traffic is distributed across replicas. &nbsp;<br>- Lambda Integration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Updating the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint (instead of direct DB connections) solves the connection exhaustion issue. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Increasing `max_connections`): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Only a temporary fix; does not address connection churn (short-lived connections still cause overhead). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Replicas may still get overwhelmed during unpredictable spikes. &nbsp;<br>- C (Instance Scaling): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Scaling Aurora instances does not solve connection pooling issues. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The Aurora reader endpoint alone doesn’t manage connections efficiently. &nbsp;<br>- D (Aurora Data API): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The Aurora Data API is for serverless apps (not connection pooling). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Misleading—RDS Proxy itself is the solution, not the Data API. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A is the most reliable solution because RDS Proxy directly addresses the connection management problem without requiring manual scaling or configuration changes. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option B is the correct answer. Using GitHub webhooks to trigger the AWS CodePipeline ensures a seamless integration between code commits and the start of the build process. Utilizing the Jenkins plugin for AWS CodeBuild allows the team to continue using their existing Jenkins configurations for unit testing within the AWS ecosystem. Sending alerts to an Amazon SNS topic for bad builds provides a notification mechanism for the team. Finally, deploying using a blue/green deployment strategy with AWS CodeDeploy helps achieve zero downtime and seamless user experience during deployments, with the ability to roll back to the previous version in case of any issues.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. GitHub integration → Webhooks (not websockets) are the correct way to trigger CodePipeline from GitHub. &nbsp;<br>2. Jenkins for builds/unit testing → The Jenkins plugin for AWS CodeBuild allows integration with existing Jenkins workflows. &nbsp;<br>3. Notifications for bad builds → Amazon SNS can send alerts for failed pipeline stages. &nbsp;<br>4. Zero downtime deployments & rollback capability → Blue/Green deployment (via AWS CodeDeploy) ensures seamless updates and easy rollback. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- GitHub Webhooks: Properly triggers CodePipeline on code changes. &nbsp;<br>- Jenkins + CodeBuild: Maintains existing CI workflows while integrating with AWS. &nbsp;<br>- SNS Alerts: Ensures engineers are notified of build failures. &nbsp;<br>- Blue/Green Deployment: Guarantees zero downtime and safe rollback. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A & D: Use in-place deployments, which cause downtime and lack rollback safety. &nbsp;<br>- C & D: Incorrectly suggest X-Ray for unit testing (X-Ray is for distributed tracing, not testing). &nbsp;<br>- A & C: Incorrectly mention websockets (GitHub uses webhooks for pipeline triggers). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the only solution that meets all requirements (GitHub webhooks, Jenkins integration, SNS alerts, and blue/green deployments). &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct answer. By configuring Lambda functions to log the tenant ID along with the consumed read and write capacity units (RCUs and WCUs) for each transaction, the company can track individual tenant resource consumption. Utilizing the AWS Cost Explorer API to calculate tenant costs based on these logged metrics allows for a dynamic and automated approach to cost allocation. Scheduling the invocation of the calculation Lambda function using Amazon EventBridge ensures that the cost allocation is performed regularly and stays up-to-date.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Granular DynamoDB cost allocation per tenant → Need to track Read Capacity Units (RCUs) and Write Capacity Units (WCUs) per tenant. &nbsp;<br>2. Least operational effort → Avoid schema changes or complex ETL processes. &nbsp;<br>3. Tiered subscription model → Must accurately measure each tenant's resource usage. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is Best? &nbsp;<br>- Log RCUs/WCUs per Tenant: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Lambda functions can log tenant_id + consumed capacity units to CloudWatch. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This provides direct visibility into DynamoDB usage per tenant. &nbsp;<br>- Automated Cost Calculation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- A scheduled Lambda function can aggregate usage data and calculate costs using the AWS Cost Explorer API. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This avoids manual analysis and provides near-real-time cost allocation. &nbsp;<br>- No Schema Changes: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Unlike Option C, this does not require modifying DynamoDB tables. &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Cost Allocation Tags): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- DynamoDB does not support per-request tagging, so tags cannot accurately track tenant-level usage in shared tables. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Only works for table-level costs, not tenant-level consumption. &nbsp;<br>- C (Partition Key + Athena): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires schema changes (operational overhead). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Athena queries add complexity and latency. &nbsp;<br>- D (Custom Metrics + Pricing Calculator): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Response size/duration ≠ RCU/WCU consumption (inaccurate for billing). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Pricing Calculator is manual and not automated. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the most accurate and least operationally intensive solution, as it: &nbsp;<br>1. Directly measures RCU/WCU consumption per tenant. &nbsp;<br>2. Automates cost allocation without schema changes. &nbsp;<br>3. Aligns with AWS-native tools (CloudWatch, Cost Explorer). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Create a new AWS account that is accessible only to the security team through an assumed role. Create an S3 bucket in the new account. Enable S3 Versioning and S3 Object Lock. Configure a default retention period of 1 year. Set up replication from the existing S3 bucket to the new S3 bucket. Create an S3 Batch Replication job to copy all existing data.<br>This solution will ensure that existing and future objects in the S3 bucket are protected for the following reasons:<br>Account Isolation: Creating a separate AWS account that's only accessible to the security team provides strong isolation from the primary account. If an attacker gains access to the primary account through leaked credentials, they won't have access to the security account where the protected data is stored.<br>Immutable Storage: S3 Object Lock with a 1-year retention period makes the data immutable - it cannot be deleted or modified by anyone, including administrators and even AWS, until the retention period expires. This is critical for protecting against attackers who might try to delete or corrupt data.<br>Data Versioning: S3 Versioning ensures that multiple versions of objects are maintained, protecting against accidental or malicious overwrites.<br>Complete Data Protection: The combination of replication for new objects and batch replication for existing data ensures that all data (both current and future) is protected in the secure secondary account.<br>Least Privilege Access: Using assumed roles for the security team follows the principle of least privilege, further reducing the attack surface.<br>Option B (using AWS Config with automatic remediation) is less effective because:<br>Same Account Vulnerability: It keeps all data in the same AWS account. If an attacker gains access to the account through leaked credentials, they could potentially disable the AWS Config rules or modify the Lambda functions used for remediation.<br>No True Immutability: While MFA Delete adds a layer of protection, it doesn't provide the same level of immutability as Object Lock. An attacker with sufficient permissions could still disable MFA Delete.<br>No Data Isolation: Without cross-account replication, there's no isolation between the production data and its protected copies.<br>Lifecycle Rules Only: The lifecycle rule would only delete objects after 1 year but doesn't prevent deletion or modification before that time.<br>The solution in option A creates a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy by combining account isolation, immutable storage, versioning, and replication to ensure that data is protected even if the primary account is compromised.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>Option A is the correct answer. By configuring the ALB to work with the OIDC identity provider, the company can ensure that only authenticated users are able to access the backend services. This integration will allow the ALB to validate the JWT tokens provided by the IdP, thereby preventing unauthenticated requests from reaching the backend.<br>The key requirements are:<br>1. All backend services must only respond to authenticated users - Currently the ALB accepts unauthenticated requests<br>2. Application already uses OIDC for authentication - The solution should leverage the existing identity provider<br>3. Two backend origins need protection - API Gateway (already secured with JWT) and ALB (needs securing)<br> Why Option A is Correct:<br>- ALB Native OIDC Integration: <br> &nbsp;- ALB can directly integrate with OIDC identity providers for authentication<br> &nbsp;- This provides the same authentication flow as the API Gateway's JWT authorizer<br> &nbsp;- Only authenticated users will reach backend services<br>- Consistent Security Model:<br> &nbsp;- Both API Gateway and ALB will use the same OIDC provider<br> &nbsp;- Provides uniform authentication across all backend services<br>- Minimal Configuration:<br> &nbsp;- Uses existing infrastructure (ALB and OIDC provider)<br> &nbsp;- No additional services needed<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>B (CloudFront Signed URLs):<br>- Signed URLs don't integrate with OIDC<br>- Would require completely separate authentication system<br>- "Permissive signing policy" contradicts security requirements<br>C (AWS WAF):<br>- WAF can't natively authenticate users<br>- Would require complex rules to inspect authentication tokens<br>- Not the proper tool for authentication<br>D (CloudTrail + Lambda):<br>- Reactive rather than preventive approach<br>- Significant latency in blocking unauthenticated requests<br>- Overly complex solution for the requirement<br> Conclusion:<br>Option A provides the most secure, efficient, and maintainable solution by:<br>1.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Implement DynamoDB auto scaling on the table.<br>This solution will improve the current response times as the web application becomes more popular for the following reasons:<br>Root Cause Analysis: The monitoring data provides important clues about where the bottleneck is occurring:<br>20% of API Gateway requests have errors<br>Lambda function has 1% throttles and 10% errors<br>Application logs show that errors occur when there's a call to DynamoDB<br>This pattern strongly suggests that DynamoDB is the primary bottleneck in the system, not Lambda concurrency.<br>Error Distribution: While Lambda is experiencing some throttling (1%), the majority of Lambda errors (10%) are occurring during DynamoDB operations. This indicates that the Lambda function is failing when it tries to interact with DynamoDB, likely due to DynamoDB throttling or capacity limitations.<br>Scaling Solution: DynamoDB auto scaling automatically adjusts the provisioned throughput capacity of your table based on actual traffic patterns. When implemented:<br>It will increase read and write capacity units during the high-demand periods caused by the marketing campaign<br>It will decrease capacity during periods of lower usage to optimize costs<br>It will help prevent throttling of DynamoDB operations that are currently causing errors<br>End-to-End Improvement: By addressing the DynamoDB bottleneck, you'll see cascading improvements:<br>Fewer DynamoDB throttling errors<br>Reduced Lambda function errors (since most errors occur during DynamoDB calls)<br>Improved API Gateway response times and fewer errors returned to clients<br>Option A (increasing the Lambda function concurrency limit) would only address the 1% of requests that are being throttled at the Lambda level. This would not solve the larger issue where 10% of Lambda executions are failing during DynamoDB operations. Increasing Lambda concurrency might actually make the problem worse by allowing more concurrent requests to hit DynamoDB, potentially increasing the throttling at the database level.<br>By implementing DynamoDB auto scaling, the solutions architect will address the root cause of the performance issues, allowing the web application to handle the increased demand from the marketing campaign and scale appropriately as it becomes more popular.<br>Sources<br>AWS REST apigateway throws 502 even though integration timeout is set to 59000 ms | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUNv9DIMb4Tv-ySS25pdvIaw/aws-rest-apigateway-throws-502-even-though-integration-timeout-is-set-to-59000-ms）<br>Lambda scaling behavior - AWS Lambda （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/scaling-behavior.html）<br>Scale lambdas to tens of thousands concurrent runnings | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUjv5PAE_dQ56EXvEpkJ1WTQ/scale-lambdas-to-tens-of-thousands-concurrent-runnings）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in three Availability Zones. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for file storage. Mount the file storage on all three EC2 instances. Use an Application Load Balancer to direct traffic to the EC2 instances.<br>This solution will meet the requirements with the fewest changes to the architecture for the following reasons:<br>Direct Mapping of Current Architecture:<br>The current architecture has three Linux VMs for redundancy, which maps directly to three EC2 instances in AWS.<br>The on-premises load balancer with HTTP request-based routing maps directly to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS, which specializes in HTTP/HTTPS traffic routing.<br>The shared file storage requirement is fulfilled by Amazon EFS, which can be mounted on all EC2 instances simultaneously.<br>High Availability:<br>Placing the EC2 instances across three Availability Zones provides high availability and fault tolerance.<br>Amazon EFS is designed to be highly available by default, with data stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones.<br>The Application Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple Availability Zones and only routes traffic to healthy instances.<br>Minimal Changes:<br>This approach maintains the same basic architecture: three servers behind a load balancer with shared file storage.<br>The application code likely requires no changes since it will still run on Linux instances with the same file system mount points.<br>The load balancing logic remains similar, with HTTP request-based routing capabilities preserved in the ALB.<br>Quick Migration Path:<br>EC2 instances can be created using AMIs that closely match the on-premises Linux environment.<br>Tools like AWS Application Migration Service (formerly CloudEndure Migration) can help migrate the existing VMs to EC2 with minimal downtime.<br>EFS provides a standard NFS interface that the application can use without code changes.<br>Operational Simplicity:<br>No need to refactor the application for containers or serverless architecture.<br>Familiar Linux administration and troubleshooting procedures can be maintained.<br>Standard mounting procedures for NFS file systems apply to EFS.<br>This solution provides a "lift and shift" approach that meets the requirement to migrate as quickly as possible while ensuring high availability in the AWS environment. It minimizes the architectural changes required, allowing the company to maintain a similar operational model while gaining the benefits of AWS's infrastructure reliability and scalability.<br>Sources<br>Moving to an AWS architecture - Hosting Static Websites on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-static-websites-aws/moving-to-an-aws-architecture.html）<br>Set up a highly available PeopleSoft architecture on AWS - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/set-up-a-highly-available-peoplesoft-architecture-on-aws.html）<br>

Install the AWS Application Discovery Agent on the on-premises servers for data collection. Grant permissions to Application Discovery Service to use the Migration Hub network diagrams.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for collecting network dependency information between the Linux-based VMware VMs for the following reasons:<br>Comprehensive Data Collection: The AWS Application Discovery Agent provides detailed information about each server, including IP addresses, hostnames, and network connections.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora, and add an Aurora Replica. Configure Amazon RDS Proxy to manage database connection pools.<br>This solution best meets the requirements for improving the scalable performance and availability of the database for the following reasons:<br>Connection Management: The primary issue identified is "slow response times during the peak periods because of many database connections." RDS Proxy directly addresses this by efficiently managing database connection pools. It maintains a pool of established database connections that can be reused by Lambda functions, which significantly reduces the connection overhead that's causing the performance issues.<br>Serverless Integration: Since the application uses AWS Lambda functions, which can scale rapidly during market events, RDS Proxy provides an ideal solution for handling the connection surge. Lambda functions create and destroy connections frequently, which can overwhelm a database. RDS Proxy acts as a buffer between the Lambda functions and the database.<br>Improved Scalability: Amazon Aurora itself offers better performance and scalability compared to standard RDS for MySQL. Adding an Aurora Replica further enhances read scalability by distributing read operations across multiple instances.<br>Enhanced Availability: Aurora's architecture already provides better availability than standard RDS MySQL. The combination of Aurora's built-in replication, Aurora Replicas, and RDS Proxy's faster failover capabilities (reducing failover time by up to 66%) creates a highly available solution.<br>No Application Code Changes: This solution can be implemented without significant changes to the application code, making it easier and faster to deploy.<br>Option C (Migrating to Aurora with a read replica and using Route 53 weighted records) is less effective because:<br>It doesn't address the core issue of connection management. Even with weighted routing, the database would still face the same connection overhead problems during peak periods.<br>Using Route 53 weighted records for database connections would require application-level changes to handle different connection endpoints for reads and writes, adding complexity.<br>Route 53 weighted records are typically used for distributing traffic across different application instances, not for managing database connections within a single application.<br>By migrating to Amazon Aurora with an Aurora Replica and implementing RDS Proxy, the company will directly address the connection bottleneck that's causing slow response times during peak periods, while also improving the overall scalability and availability of their database infrastructure.<br>Sources<br>Amazon RDS Proxy - Oracle to Aurora MySQL Migration Playbook （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/oracle-to-aurora-mysql-migration-playbook/chap-oracle-aurora-mysql.tools.rdsproxy.html）<br>Amazon RDS Proxy - Oracle to Aurora PostgreSQL Migration Playbook （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/oracle-to-aurora-postgresql-migration-playbook/chap-oracle-aurora-pg.tools.rdsproxy.html）<br>Highly Available Database Proxy – Amazon RDS Proxy – Amazon Web Services （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/rds/proxy/）<br>

Configure CloudFront to inject the random string as a custom HTTP header for the origin request. Create an AWS WAF web ACL rule with a string match rule for the custom header. Associate the web ACL with the ALB.<br>This solution enhances origin security through a custom header verification approach, which is considered a best practice for securing CloudFront to ALB communication. Here's why this is the better solution:<br>Custom Origin Header Authentication: By configuring CloudFront to add a secret custom header to requests sent to the ALB, you create a verification mechanism that ensures only requests coming through CloudFront are processed by the ALB. This prevents direct access to the ALB, even if someone discovers its DNS name.<br>Dynamic Secret Management: Storing the random string in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation via Lambda ensures that the authentication mechanism remains secure over time. Even if the header value is somehow compromised, it will be automatically changed on a regular basis.<br>Defense in Depth: This approach implements multiple layers of security - the secret itself, the custom header mechanism, and the WAF rule that validates the header.<br>Maintains Existing Architecture: This solution doesn't require moving the ALB from public to private subnets, which could potentially require significant architectural changes.<br>Option B (creating a WAF rule based on CloudFront IP ranges and moving the ALB to private subnets) has several limitations:<br>CloudFront IP Ranges Change: CloudFront operates from many edge locations with IP addresses that can change over time. Maintaining an accurate list of all CloudFront IP addresses in WAF rules would require frequent updates.<br>Less Secure Authentication: IP-based filtering alone is generally considered less secure than cryptographic verification methods like secret headers.<br>Architectural Changes: Moving the ALB from public to private subnets would require additional components like NAT gateways for the EC2 instances to access the internet, potentially increasing complexity and cost.<br>The custom header approach (Option A) is a widely recommended best practice by AWS for securing communication between CloudFront and origin servers. It provides strong security through cryptographic verification rather than relying solely on network-level controls, making it the more robust solution for enhancing origin security in this scenario.<br>Sources<br>Custom origin with CloudFront - Secure Content Delivery with Amazon CloudFront （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/SecurityAndPrivateContent.html）<br>WAF on ALB or CloudFront ? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUTY5hPVxgS6Caa3eZHX7-nQ/waf-on-alb-or-cloudfront）<br>

Use Direct Connect Gateway to access data in other AWS Regions.<br>This solution meets all the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Multi-Region Data Storage: The solution supports storing critical data in multiple public AWS Regions, including in the United States where the company's headquarters is located, which satisfies the industry regulation requirement.<br>Private Network Access: By using AWS Direct Connect, the company establishes a dedicated private connection between their headquarters and AWS, ensuring that no traffic traverses the public internet as mandated by the security team.<br>High Availability: The solution includes two Direct Connect connections from the company headquarters to an AWS Region, providing redundancy and high availability. If one connection fails, traffic can still flow through the second connection.<br>Global Access: The company can leverage their existing global WAN network to route traffic to the Direct Connect connections at headquarters. This allows offices worldwide to access the AWS resources through the company's private network.<br>Multi-Region Connectivity: Direct Connect Gateway is a global service that enables the company to access multiple AWS Regions through their Direct Connect connections. This means they can access data stored in any connected Region without having to establish separate Direct Connect connections to each Region.<br>Cost-Effectiveness: This solution is cost-effective because:<br>It leverages the existing company WAN infrastructure<br>It requires Direct Connect connections only at the headquarters location, not at every global office<br>Direct Connect Gateway eliminates the need for separate connections to each AWS Region<br>Traffic between Regions stays on AWS's private global network, avoiding data transfer charges associated with public internet traffic<br>The solution creates a secure, private network path from the company's global offices to multiple AWS Regions:<br>Global offices connect to the company headquarters via the existing global WAN<br>Headquarters connects to AWS via redundant Direct Connect connections<br>Direct Connect Gateway enables access to multiple AWS Regions<br>All traffic remains on private networks (company WAN and AWS global network), never traversing the public internet<br>This architecture satisfies the industry regulations for multi-region data storage while meeting the security team's requirement for private network access, all while maintaining high availability and cost-effectiveness.<br>Sources<br>AWS Direct Connect &nbsp;- Building a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/direct-connect.html）<br>Direct Connect gateway attachments in AWS Cloud WAN - AWS Network Manager （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-dxattach-about.html）<br>How Salesforce Business Technology uses AWS Direct Connect SiteLink for reliable global connectivity | Networking & Content Delivery （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/how-salesforce-business-technology-uses-aws-direct-connect-sitelink-for-reliable-global-connectivity/）<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>The correct answer is B. Configure AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery. Replicate the data to replication Amazon EC2 instances that are attached to Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. When the on-premises environment is unavailable, use Elastic Disaster Recovery to launch EC2 instances that use the replicated volumes.<br> Explanation:<br>1. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) is designed specifically for this use case—disaster recovery with minimal operational overhead. It continuously replicates on-premises VMware vSphere VMs (or physical servers) to AWS, maintaining a ready-to-launch state in a low-cost staging area.<br>2. RPO of 5 minutes: Elastic Disaster Recovery supports frequent replication (as low as seconds), meeting the 5-minute RPO requirement.<br>3. Automated failover and recovery: When a disaster occurs, you can quickly launch fully provisioned EC2 instances from the replicated data with minimal manual intervention.<br>4. Return to on-premises: After the disaster is resolved, you can fail back to your on-premises environment.<br>5. Least operational overhead: Elastic Disaster Recovery handles the replication, orchestration, and recovery process automatically, reducing manual steps compared to other options.<br> Why not the other options?<br>- A (AWS DataSync + CloudFormation): DataSync is for data transfer but doesn’t automate VM replication or disaster recovery orchestration. Manual steps for provisioning EC2 instances and attaching EBS volumes increase overhead.<br>- C (Storage Gateway + AWS Backup): Storage Gateway is not designed for low-RPO disaster recovery. Restoring from S3 to EBS and launching EC2 instances manually is time-consuming and complex.<br>- D (Amazon FSx + CloudFormation): FSx is for file storage, not full VM replication. Mounting file shares doesn’t address the need for application server recovery, and manual steps add overhead.<br>B is the best solution because it provides automated, continuous replication and recovery with minimal operational effort.<br>

<br>Answer: C<br>The company is experiencing significant lag when data is uploaded from applications running in new AWS Regions (sa-east-1 and ap-northeast-1) to an S3 bucket in the eu-north-1 Region. The requirement is to minimize this lag while maintaining centralized storage for data analysis in the eu-north-1 S3 bucket.<br>Options Analysis:<br><ul><li>A: Setting up Lambda functions in a VPC with an S3 Gateway Endpoint does not address the lag issue. While this can optimize network traffic within a region, it does not improve cross-region data transfer latency.</li><li>B: Enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration in the eu-north-1 bucket can improve upload speed by utilizing Amazon’s globally distributed edge locations to accelerate data transfer. However, this may not fully eliminate the lag compared to replicating data across regions.</li><li>C: Creating an S3 bucket in each new Region (sa-east-1 and ap-northeast-1) allows the application to upload data locally, minimizing latency. Setting up S3 Cross-Region Replication ensures that data is automatically synchronized with the centralized S3 bucket in eu-north-1, maintaining the centralized data storage for analysis. This approach effectively reduces lag while meeting the requirement for centralization.</li><li>D: Increasing memory for Lambda functions or enabling the multipart upload feature may slightly improve upload performance but does not directly address the lag caused by cross-region data transfer.</li></ul><br>Key Benefits of Option C:<br><ul><li>Reduced Latency: Local S3 buckets in the same region as the application minimize the time taken to upload data.</li><li>Centralized Data Storage: S3 Cross-Region Replication ensures that all data is eventually centralized in the eu-north-1 bucket for analysis without manual intervention.</li><li>Scalability: This solution efficiently supports the company’s global expansion without requiring significant changes to existing workflows.</li></ul><br>Thus, Option C is the most effective solution for improving lag time while meeting the requirements.<br>

<br>Answer: B<br>The company hosts a centralized EC2 application in a shared VPC, fronted by a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Multiple business unit VPCs (up to 10) need connectivity to this centralized application. However, the following challenges must be addressed:<br><ol><li>Overlapping CIDR blocks: Some business unit VPC CIDR blocks overlap with the shared VPC or with each other.</li><li>Restrict access: Only authorized business unit VPCs should be able to connect to the centralized application.</li></ol><br>Options Analysis:<br><ul><li>A: Use AWS Transit Gateway (TGW):A Transit Gateway could connect multiple VPCs, but it does not solve the problem of overlapping CIDR blocks. Transit Gateway operates at the IP layer and cannot manage overlapping IP ranges efficiently.</li><li>B: Create a VPC Endpoint Service using the NLB:Creating a VPC Endpoint Service backed by the NLB allows authorized VPCs to connect to the centralized application without IP layer routing. This solves the overlapping CIDR issue because VPC endpoints use private DNS and do not rely on IP addressing.Requiring endpoint acceptance ensures that only authorized VPCs can connect to the centralized application. This satisfies the requirement to restrict access.This option is scalable and avoids the complexity of managing additional route tables or gateways.</li><li>C: VPC Peering Connections:VPC peering does not support overlapping CIDR blocks, making it unsuitable for this scenario.It would also require manual configuration and maintenance of individual peering connections, making it less scalable.</li><li>D: Site-to-Site VPN:Configuring a Site-to-Site VPN for each business unit VPC is unnecessarily complex and costly for this use case.VPN connections are better suited for on-premises connectivity rather than inter-VPC communication.</li></ul><br>Why Option B is Correct:<br><ol><li>Scalability: VPC Endpoint Services can scale easily to handle multiple client VPCs.</li><li>CIDR Overlap Resolution: VPC Endpoint Services operate at the DNS layer and do not depend on IP routing, which eliminates issues caused by overlapping CIDR blocks.</li><li>Access Control: Requiring endpoint acceptance ensures only authorized business units can connect to the application.</li></ol><br>Conclusion:<br>Option B is the most effective solution because it addresses overlapping CIDR blocks, supports access control, and provides a scalable way to connect business unit VPCs to the centralized application.<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. Create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster that has managed node groups. Copy the application containers to a new Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository. Deploy the manifests from on premises to the EKS cluster. Create an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Least Effort Migration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The company already uses Kubernetes (self-managed on-premises), so migrating to Amazon EKS (AWS-managed Kubernetes) requires minimal changes. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Kubernetes manifests can be reused as-is (no need to rewrite deployments for ECS or App Runner). &nbsp;<br>2. Container Management: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Moving containers to Amazon ECR (AWS-managed container registry) is straightforward and more secure than maintaining an open-source repository. &nbsp;<br>3. Database Migration: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is fully compatible with PostgreSQL and offers better performance, scalability, and managed operations compared to self-managed PostgreSQL. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (AWS App Runner): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- App Runner is a simpler PaaS service but does not support Kubernetes manifests, requiring a rewrite of deployment logic. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Tying App Runner to an on-premises container registry is not ideal for AWS migration. &nbsp;<br>- C (Amazon ECS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- ECS is a good alternative but requires converting Kubernetes manifests to ECS task definitions, increasing migration effort. &nbsp;<br>- D (Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This does not reduce operational overhead—it just moves the same complexity to AWS (still requires managing EC2, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL manually). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B (EKS + ECR + Aurora PostgreSQL) is the best choice because: &nbsp;<br>✔ Minimal changes (reuse existing Kubernetes manifests). &nbsp;<br>✔ Fully managed services (EKS, ECR, Aurora reduce operational burden). &nbsp;<br>✔ Seamless PostgreSQL migration (Aurora is PostgreSQL-compatible). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Migrate the storage of the contest entries to Amazon DynamoDB. Rewrite the code as AWS Lambda functions. Set the DynamoDB TTL attribute on each entry to expire each entry at the end of the contest.<br>This solution will meet the requirements most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>Pay-per-use Model: By migrating from EC2 instances and RDS databases to Lambda functions and DynamoDB, the company will shift from paying for continuously running resources to paying only for what they use. Since contests run for variable lengths of time, this approach eliminates costs during periods of inactivity.<br>Automatic Scaling: Lambda functions automatically scale based on the number of incoming requests, which is ideal for handling variable contest loads without overprovisioning resources. Similarly, DynamoDB can scale to accommodate any number of contest entries.<br>Automated Data Cleanup: The DynamoDB Time-to-Live (TTL) feature allows for automatic deletion of data after a specified time. This perfectly aligns with the requirement that "the company does not need to retain any data from a contest after the contest is finished." The TTL attribute can be set to expire entries at the end of each contest, eliminating the need for manual cleanup processes.<br>Reduced Operational Overhead: Both Lambda and DynamoDB are fully managed services, which means AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, patching, and maintenance. This reduces the operational burden and associated costs.<br>No Idle Resources: With the serverless approach, there are no idle resources to pay for between contests or during periods of low activity. The company only pays for actual compute time used by Lambda and the actual storage and throughput consumed in DynamoDB.<br>Simplified Architecture: The serverless architecture eliminates the need to manage load balancers, EC2 instances, and RDS databases, resulting in a simpler, more cost-effective solution that still meets the functional requirements of running contests and selecting winners.<br>Efficient Processing: Lambda functions are well-suited for the task of randomly selecting a winner at the end of each contest, as this is a relatively short-lived, event-driven process.<br>This solution provides the most cost-effective approach by aligning the cost structure with the actual usage patterns of the contest application, automatically managing resources based on demand, and eliminating unnecessary costs for data retention after contests end.<br>Sources<br>AWS Well-Architected design considerations - Account Assessment for AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/account-assessment-for-aws-organizations/aws-well-architected.html）<br>How to Trigger RDS and EC2 to automatically start up | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUv5qKD3q3QxOWoISBJiy3UA/how-to-trigger-rds-and-ec2-to-automatically-start-up）<br>Community | EC2 cost optimization:15 ways to save on Amazon EC2 （https://community.aws/content/2hQNGTh6vpwOHTgKELzL8mkqmKb/ec2-cost-optimization-15-ways-to-save-on-amazon-ec2）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The correct answer is A. Disable source/destination checks on the EC2 instances that run the proxy software.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Problem Identification:<br> &nbsp; - The proxy EC2 instances are deployed as transparent proxies, meaning they intercept and forward traffic for other instances in the VPC.<br> &nbsp; - By default, EC2 instances perform source/destination checks, meaning they drop traffic that is not explicitly destined for or originating from their own IP addresses.<br> &nbsp; - Since the proxies are forwarding traffic on behalf of other instances, the source/destination checks must be disabled to allow this behavior.<br>2. Why Option A Works:<br> &nbsp; - Disabling source/destination checks allows the proxy instances to handle traffic that is not destined for their own IPs, which is necessary for transparent proxying.<br> &nbsp; - This is a well-documented requirement for EC2 instances acting as NAT instances, firewalls, or proxies.<br>3. Why Not the Other Options?<br> &nbsp; - B (Security group rules for all traffic): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - While security groups must allow traffic between instances, this alone does not solve the source/destination check issue.<br> &nbsp; - C (Modify DHCP options set for DNS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - This is unrelated to the forwarding of internet-bound traffic through proxies.<br> &nbsp; - D (Add additional ENIs with specific routes): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - While multi-homed proxies can be used in some architectures, this is not necessary for basic transparent proxying and does not address the core issue (source/destination checks).<br> Conclusion:<br>Option A is the correct solution because it directly addresses the source/destination check issue, which is the primary reason traffic is not being forwarded properly. Disabling this feature allows the proxy instances to handle traffic for other instances in the VPC.<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Create a new CloudFormation template that strictly provisions the existing VPC resources and configuration. From the CloudFormation console, create a new stack by importing the Existing resources.<br>This solution will meet the requirement to manage all infrastructure in an automatic way with the least effort for the following reasons:<br>Direct Import Capability: CloudFormation provides a built-in feature specifically designed for importing existing resources into a stack. This "Import resources into stack" feature allows you to bring manually created resources under CloudFormation management without having to recreate them.<br>No Additional Tools Required: Unlike option A (using AWS CDK), this approach doesn't require setting up and learning an additional tool or programming model. The company is already using CloudFormation for other parts of their infrastructure, so continuing with CloudFormation maintains consistency.<br>Simplified Process: The CloudFormation console provides a guided workflow for importing existing resources:<br>Create a template that matches the existing VPC configuration<br>Use the "Create stack" &gt; "With existing resources (import resources)" option<br>Select the resources to import<br>Complete the import process<br>Preservation of Existing Resources: This approach doesn't require creating new resources or making changes to the existing VPC. It simply brings the existing VPC under CloudFormation management.<br>Integration with Existing Infrastructure: Since the company is already using CloudFormation for other parts of their infrastructure, this approach allows for seamless integration between the newly imported VPC and the existing CloudFormation-managed resources.<br>Option A (using AWS CDK) would require additional effort to set up the CDK environment, learn the CDK programming model, and write code to define the infrastructure, which is more complex than using CloudFormation directly.<br>Option B (using CloudFormation stack sets) is not appropriate for this scenario. Stack sets are designed for deploying stacks across multiple accounts and regions, not for importing existing resources. This approach would likely create new resources rather than importing existing ones.<br>By creating a CloudFormation template that matches the existing VPC configuration and using the import feature, the company can bring their manually created VPC under automated management with minimal effort while preserving their existing infrastructure.<br>Sources<br>Import entire applications into AWS CloudFormation | AWS DevOps Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/devops/import-entire-applications-into-aws-cloudformation/）<br>How can I move a serverless VPC endpoint to another CloudFormation stack? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUKDx-TuTYRXa1wzy_xOfMyA/how-can-i-move-a-serverless-vpc-endpoint-to-another-cloudformation-stack）<br>Import AWS resources into a CloudFormation stack - AWS CloudFormation （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/import-resources.html）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Configure Amazon Route 53 and an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting. Upload the game files to the S3 bucket. Use Amazon CloudFront for the website. Publish the game download URL for users to download the package.<br>This solution will provide improved download performance and low transfer costs for the video game release for the following reasons:<br>Global Content Delivery Network: Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) with a global network of edge locations. When users request the game download, CloudFront delivers it from the edge location that provides the lowest latency, significantly improving download performance regardless of the user's location.<br>Cost-Effective Data Transfer: CloudFront offers cost-effective data transfer rates, especially for large files like the 5GB game package. CloudFront's pricing model includes:<br>Reduced data transfer costs compared to serving directly from S3<br>Regional data transfer pricing that can be more economical for global distribution<br>Caching at edge locations that reduces origin fetches and associated costs<br>Scalability: This architecture can easily handle the high demand expected for a popular video game release. S3 provides virtually unlimited storage capacity, while CloudFront can scale to handle millions of concurrent users downloading the game.<br>Simple Implementation: The solution is straightforward to implement:<br>Amazon S3 provides reliable storage for the game files<br>Route 53 handles DNS resolution to direct users to the CloudFront distribution<br>CloudFront distributes the content globally with minimal configuration<br>Improved Reliability: Moving from an on-premises FTP server to AWS cloud services increases reliability and availability. The solution eliminates single points of failure that might exist in the current on-premises setup.<br>Support for Large Files: The solution is well-suited for distributing large files like the 5GB game package. CloudFront supports efficient delivery of large objects and can handle partial downloads if users need to resume interrupted downloads.<br>Reduced Origin Load: By caching content at edge locations, CloudFront reduces the load on the origin S3 bucket, which helps maintain consistent performance even during peak download periods.<br>This architecture represents a significant improvement over the current on-premises FTP solution, providing better global performance, lower costs, and improved reliability for distributing the new game release to users worldwide.<br>Sources<br>Speeding up your Amazon S3-based website using Amazon CloudFront - Hosting Static Websites on AWS （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/build-static-websites-aws/speeding-up-your-amazon-s3-based-website-using-amazon-cloudfront.html）<br>Cost-effective resources - Games Industry Lens （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/games-industry-lens/games-cost-cost-eff-resc.html）<br>

<br>1. A. Place the Tomcat server in an Auto Scaling group with multiple EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Why? The website outages are caused by high traffic. Auto Scaling ensures the application can scale horizontally to handle increased load, while an ALB distributes traffic across instances. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Impact: Improves fault tolerance and availability by preventing single-instance failures.<br>2. C. Migrate the MySQL database to Amazon Aurora with one Aurora Replica. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Why? The current single EC2-based MySQL database is a single point of failure. Aurora provides high availability with automatic failover to a replica in another AZ. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Impact: Increases database reliability and performance while reducing management overhead.<br>3. F. Create an additional public subnet in a different Availability Zone in the website VPC. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Why? The website runs in a single public subnet, making it vulnerable to AZ failures. Adding a subnet in another AZ improves redundancy when combined with Auto Scaling. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Impact: Ensures multi-AZ resilience for the web tier.<br>---<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- B (Additional VPC peering connection): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- VPC peering is not a bottleneck in this scenario (only one connection is needed). &nbsp;<br>- D (NAT gateways in the database VPC): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- The database is in private subnets and likely doesn’t need NAT for outbound internet access. This doesn’t address website outages. &nbsp;<br>- E (Move Tomcat to the database VPC): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This doesn’t improve reliability—it just consolidates resources but doesn’t solve scaling or high availability issues. &nbsp;<br>---<br> Summary of Correct Actions: &nbsp;<br>✔ A (Auto Scaling + ALB) → Handles traffic spikes. &nbsp;<br>✔ C (Aurora with replica) → Eliminates database single point of failure. &nbsp;<br>✔ F (Multi-AZ subnets) → Ensures web tier redundancy. &nbsp;<br>

<br> A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure the S3 bucket to host a static webpage. Upload the custom error pages to Amazon S3.<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- S3 is a simple, cost-effective way to host static error pages (e.g., `502.html`). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires minimal operational overhead—just upload the custom error page and enable static website hosting. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Works seamlessly with CloudFront (next step). &nbsp;<br> E.

Attach all the company's VPCs and relevant subnets to the transit gateway.<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS Transit Gateway is designed for scalable, hub-and-spoke VPC connectivity across multiple accounts and regions. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- It eliminates the need for complex VPC peering meshes (which become unmanageable as the number of VPCs grows). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Supports dynamic routing and simplifies network management as new VPCs are added. &nbsp;<br> C. Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) that points to the compute resource for license validation. Create an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service that is available to each customer's VPC. Associate the endpoint service with the NLB.<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- PrivateLink provides secure, one-way access from customer VPCs to the management VPC (license validation). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Avoids exposing the management VPC to the internet or requiring complex VPN setups. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Scales automatically as new customers are onboarded. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- B (VPC peering between all VPCs): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Does not scale—50+ VPCs would require a full mesh of peering connections, which is operationally prohibitive. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manual management is required for each new VPC. &nbsp;<br>- D (Site-to-Site VPN per customer VPC): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- High operational overhead—each VPN requires manual setup and maintenance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Not scalable for a growing SaaS solution. &nbsp;<br>- E (VPC peering between management VPC and each customer VPC): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Limited to 125 peering connections per VPC, which is insufficient for large-scale growth. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Manual effort for each new customer VPC. &nbsp;<br> Summary of Correct Steps: &nbsp;<br>1. Use Transit Gateway (A) for scalable, centralized communication between all SaaS VPCs. &nbsp;<br>2. Use PrivateLink (C) for secure, one-way access to the management VPC (license validation). &nbsp;<br>This approach provides scalability, security, and minimal operational overhead as the SaaS solution grows. &nbsp;<br>

<br> B. Use AWS Organizations to create a single organization in the parent account. Then, invite each LOB's AWS account to join the organization.<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS Organizations allows the parent company to consolidate billing under a single invoice while breaking out costs per LOB. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Provides a centralized way to manage multiple accounts under a single organization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Supports Service Control Policies (SCPs) for governance (next step). &nbsp;<br> D. Create an SCP that allows only approved services and features, then apply the policy to the LOB accounts.<br>- Why? &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Service Control Policies (SCPs) enforce governance by restricting services/features in LOB accounts while still allowing full admin permissions within allowed boundaries. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Ensures compliance with company policies without limiting LOB admins' control over permitted services. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A (Multiple Organizations per LOB): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Incorrect: AWS allows only one organization per account hierarchy. Creating multiple organizations is not feasible. &nbsp;<br>- C (Service Quotas): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Service quotas limit usage (e.g., EC2 instance count) but do not restrict services/features like SCPs do. &nbsp;<br>- E (Consolidated Billing Only): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Consolidated billing is outdated (replaced by AWS Organizations). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Does not provide governance controls (SCPs are needed). &nbsp;<br> Summary of Correct Steps: &nbsp;<br>1.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>D. The setting to evaluate target health is not turned on for the latency alias resource record set that is associated with the domain in the Region where the web servers were stopped.<br>E. An HTTP health check has not been set up for one or more of the weighted resource record sets associated with the stopped web servers.<br>These are the two possible root causes of the issue where Route 53 is not automatically redirecting users to the other Region during the disaster recovery scenario. Let me explain why:<br>Evaluate Target Health Setting (Option D):<br>In a Route 53 configuration with latency-based routing, the "Evaluate Target Health" setting is crucial for failover functionality.<br>When this setting is enabled on a latency alias record, Route 53 checks the health of the underlying resources (in this case, the weighted record sets for the web servers).<br>If this setting is turned off, Route 53 will continue to route traffic based solely on latency calculations, regardless of whether the resources in that Region are actually available.<br>Without evaluating target health, Route 53 has no way to know that the web servers in one Region have been stopped, so it continues to direct some users to that Region based on latency.<br>Missing HTTP Health Checks (Option E):<br>For Route 53 to determine if resources are healthy, specific health checks must be configured and associated with the resource record sets.<br>In this architecture, the weighted record sets for individual web servers need HTTP health checks to monitor their availability.<br>Without these health checks, Route 53 cannot detect that the web servers have been stopped.<br>Even if "Evaluate Target Health" is enabled, without proper health checks, Route 53 has no data to evaluate and will assume the resources are healthy.<br>The combination of these two issues prevents the automatic failover mechanism from working properly. When the web servers in one Region are stopped:<br>Without health checks (Option E), Route 53 doesn't know the servers are down.<br>Without evaluating target health (Option D), Route 53 doesn't consider health status in its routing decisions.<br>To fix this issue, the solutions architect would need to:<br>Enable the "Evaluate Target Health" setting for the latency alias resource record sets<br>Set up HTTP health checks for all weighted resource record sets associated with the web servers<br>Associate these health checks with the appropriate record sets<br>With these configurations in place, Route 53 would detect when servers in one Region are unavailable and automatically redirect traffic to the healthy servers in the other Region, ensuring the disaster recovery mechanism works as expected.<br>Sources<br>How health checks work in complex Amazon Route 53 configurations - Amazon Route 53 （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html）<br>Fast Failover using Active-Passive failover policy | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUyGuTcle8Q1-GsnNKThE6zQ/fast-failover-using-active-passive-failover-policy）<br>

<br>The correct answer is B. Send the sensor data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Use an AWS Lambda function to read the Kinesis Data Firehose data, convert it to Apache Parquet format, and save it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Instruct the data analysts to query the data by using Amazon Athena.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Problem Requirements:<br> &nbsp; - High availability & reduced maintenance: Eliminate downtime caused by on-premises server maintenance.<br> &nbsp; - Handle 10,000+ sensors: Scalable ingestion of continuous, small (&lt;1 MB) data updates.<br> &nbsp; - Cost & operational efficiency: Minimize overhead while ensuring analysts can query data easily.<br>2. Why Option B Works Best:<br> &nbsp; - AWS IoT Core + Kinesis Data Firehose: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - IoT Core scales seamlessly for 10,000+ sensors. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Firehose buffers and batches data efficiently, reducing costs. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Lambda for transformation: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Converts raw data to Parquet (columnar format), optimizing storage and query performance. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Amazon S3 + Athena: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Serverless architecture (no maintenance, high availability). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Analysts use simple SQL queries (familiar, no changes needed). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Cost-effective (pay per query, no database provisioning). &nbsp;<br>3. Why Not the Other Options?<br> &nbsp; - A (Aurora MySQL): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Operational overhead (database management, scaling, patching). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Higher cost for continuous writes from 10,000 sensors. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - C (Managed Flink → CSV → Aurora): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Overkill for simple transformations (Flink is for complex streaming analytics). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - CSV is less efficient than Parquet for analytics. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Aurora adds unnecessary cost/complexity. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - D (Managed Flink → Parquet + Athena): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Flink is excessive for basic data conversion (Lambda is simpler/cheaper). &nbsp;<br> Key Benefits of Option B:<br>✔ Fully serverless (zero maintenance, scales automatically). &nbsp;<br>✔ Cost-optimized (Firehose batching, S3 storage, Athena pay-per-query). &nbsp;<br>✔ High performance (Parquet + Athena enables fast SQL queries). &nbsp;<br>✔ Meets all requirements with minimal operational effort. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

Option B is correct as it allows for a scalable and manageable way to connect multiple development accounts to the shared DB cluster using transit gateway and AWS RAM, with minimal operational overhead. Option A is not correct because AWS RAM cannot directly share an Amazon Aurora DB cluster. Option C is incorrect because PrivateLink requires a Network Load Balancer (NLB), not an ALB. Option D is less efficient as it requires managing VPN connections for each development account.

<br>The correct answer is D. Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to create a cost monitor that has a monitor type of AWS services. Create a subscription to send daily AWS cost summaries to the operations team. Specify a threshold for cost variance.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Problem Requirements:<br> &nbsp; - Detect unused resources (e.g., forgotten test instances).<br> &nbsp; - Monitor cost increases in the AWS bill.<br> &nbsp; - Automatically notify the operations team when anomalies occur.<br>2. Why Option D Works Best:<br> &nbsp; - AWS Cost Anomaly Detection:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Automatically identifies unusual spending patterns (e.g., sudden spikes from forgotten test resources).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Monitor type: AWS services → Tracks cost changes per service (e.g., EC2, S3), making it easy to pinpoint which resource caused the increase.<br> &nbsp; - Daily cost summaries + threshold alerts:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Proactively notifies the operations team when costs deviate from expected baselines.<br> &nbsp; - Fully automated (no manual analysis needed).<br>3. Why Not the Other Options?<br> &nbsp; - A & B (Billing alerts + CloudWatch alarms):<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Reactive—only triggers after costs exceed a fixed threshold.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Does not identify the root cause (e.g., which service/resource caused the spike).<br> &nbsp; - C (Cost Anomaly Detection with "Linked account" monitor type):<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Tracks anomalies per account, not per service → Less granular for identifying unused resources.<br> Key Benefits of Option D:<br>✔ Automatic anomaly detection (machine learning-based, no manual setup). &nbsp;<br>✔ Service-level granularity (identifies exactly which AWS service/resource is causing cost increases). &nbsp;<br>✔ Proactive alerts (notifies operations team before costs spiral). &nbsp;<br>https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-anomaly<br>detection/faqs/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20linked%20account%20monitor%20in%20a%20 <br>payer%20account,%20and%20a%20services%20monitor%20in%20a%20linked%20account<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct choice as it provides an automated solution that minimizes operational complexity. By using a Lambda function triggered by S3 events, the process of separating and storing each member account's data is automated, requiring no manual intervention. Each account is then given access to only its own data prefix in the S3 bucket, ensuring that business units cannot access each other's data.<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Each business unit (AWS account) should have access to only its own cost and usage data. &nbsp;<br>2. The solution should use the existing centralized Cost and Usage Report (CUR) in an S3 bucket. &nbsp;<br>3. The solution should have the least operational complexity. &nbsp;<br>Let's analyze the options: &nbsp;<br> Option A: Using AWS RAM to share the CUR data &nbsp;<br>- AWS RAM is typically used for sharing resources like VPC subnets or License Manager configurations, not S3 data. &nbsp;<br>- Even if shared, the entire CUR dataset would be accessible to all accounts, violating the requirement of restricting access to only each account's own data. &nbsp;<br>- Not a valid solution. &nbsp;<br> Option B: Using S3 events + Lambda to filter and partition data &nbsp;<br>1. A Lambda function is triggered whenever a new CUR file arrives in the S3 bucket. &nbsp;<br>2. The Lambda function extracts data per account and stores it under separate prefixes (e.g., `BusinessUnitA/`, `BusinessUnitB/`). &nbsp;<br>3. An S3 bucket policy is updated to restrict each account to its own prefix using IAM conditions (e.g., `s3:prefix` or `aws:PrincipalAccount`). &nbsp;<br>- This ensures least operational complexity because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No manual setup is needed for each new account. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The CUR remains centralized, but access is restricted per account. &nbsp;<br>- Meets all requirements. &nbsp;<br> Option C: Using AWS Cost Explorer &nbsp;<br>- Cost Explorer provides high-level cost data, not the detailed CUR data required for Athena queries. &nbsp;<br>- Saved reports in Cost Explorer cannot be queried with Athena. &nbsp;<br>- Does not meet the requirement. &nbsp;<br> Option D: Setting up separate CURs per account &nbsp;<br>- This would require managing multiple CURs, increasing operational overhead. &nbsp;<br>- The question states that a central CUR is already available, so this approach is redundant. &nbsp;<br>- Higher operational complexity. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the best solution because it: &nbsp;<br>✔ Uses the existing centralized CUR. &nbsp;<br>✔ Automatically filters and partitions data per account. &nbsp;<br>✔ Restricts access using S3 bucket policies. &nbsp;<br>✔ Minimizes operational complexity. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT). Store the videos as objects in Amazon S3. Store the S3 key in the corresponding DynamoDB item.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Rapid Scaling for Video Storage: Amazon S3 is specifically designed for object storage and can scale virtually without limits to store large files like the 4GB videos mentioned in the requirements. S3 can handle any number of uploads and downloads concurrently without performance degradation.<br>Performance Optimization: By storing only the S3 object keys (references) in DynamoDB and keeping the actual video files in S3, the database remains lightweight and optimized for fast queries. This separation ensures that the application's performance is not affected by the large video files.<br>Cost Efficiency: S3's tiered storage options provide cost-effective storage for large binary files like videos, which would be much more expensive to store in a database.<br>Appropriate Use of Services: This solution follows AWS best practices by using each service for its intended purpose:<br>DynamoDB for fast, scalable access to structured user profile data<br>S3 for scalable, durable storage of large binary objects (videos)<br>Migration Path: AWS DMS with AWS SCT provides a straightforward path to migrate from the on-premises MySQL database to DynamoDB, handling the schema differences between relational and NoSQL databases.<br>Option A (storing videos as base64-encoded strings in Aurora PostgreSQL) would not meet the requirements because:<br>Poor Scalability: Storing large binary files as base64 strings in a database doesn't scale well as the number of videos increases.<br>Performance Impact: Base64 encoding increases the size of the data by approximately 33%, making a 4GB video closer to 5.3GB when stored. This would significantly impact database performance, query times, and backup/restore operations.<br>Database Bloat: As more videos are uploaded, the database would grow rapidly, leading to increased costs and management complexity.<br>Inefficient Use of Resources: Relational databases are not optimized for storing and retrieving large binary objects, especially at scale.<br>The solution that uses DynamoDB for user profile data and S3 for video storage represents a modern, cloud-native approach that aligns with AWS best practices for handling different types of data.

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
Option A is correct because it allows for a more frequent backup schedule that meets the RPO requirement of 100 minutes. By creating a new backup plan with an hourly schedule, the company can ensure that deleted documents can be recovered within the specified time frame. The other options do not provide a means to achieve the RPO as effectively: Option B would require additional setup and may not integrate as seamlessly with AWS Backup, Option C's continuous backups are not supported for EFS, and Option D's Cross Region Replication does not provide point-in-time recovery for deleted documents.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Use the Windows Web Application Migration Assistant to migrate the applications to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy and manage the applications.<br>This solution will meet the company's requirements for the following reasons:<br>Minimal Migration Time: The Windows Web Application Migration Assistant is specifically designed to streamline the migration of Windows-based applications to AWS with minimal effort. It automates much of the migration process, allowing for faster deployment compared to refactoring and containerizing applications.<br>No Application Code Changes: This approach allows the legacy .NET Framework applications to be migrated "as-is" without requiring any code modifications. The Windows Web Application Migration Assistant preserves the existing application structure and configurations, focusing on moving the applications rather than changing them.<br>Managed Infrastructure: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that handles the underlying infrastructure, including capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create an AWS Batch compute environment that includes Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. Specify the SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED allocation strategy.<br>This solution will meet the requirements most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>Large Data Processing Capability: AWS Batch is specifically designed to handle large-scale batch processing jobs. It can easily process the 15-20 GB of data per job without the limitations that would affect a serverless approach.<br>Cost Optimization: EC2 Spot Instances offer significant cost savings (up to 90% compared to On-Demand instances) for workloads that can tolerate interruptions. Since the requirements explicitly state that "the process can withstand interruptions" and "results are not time sensitive," Spot Instances are an ideal fit.<br>Interruption Handling: The SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED allocation strategy specifically selects Spot Instances from the pools that are least likely to be interrupted, further improving job reliability while maintaining cost benefits.<br>Flexibility for Resource-Intensive Jobs: AWS Batch allows you to select appropriate instance types and sizes to efficiently handle the computational requirements of the simulation jobs, which may be resource-intensive.<br>Built-in Job Management: AWS Batch includes features for job queuing, dependency tracking, and automatic retries, which are valuable for managing batch processing workflows.<br>Option A (using Step Functions with Lambda functions) would be less suitable because:<br>Lambda Limitations: Lambda functions have constraints that make them less ideal for processing large datasets:<br>15-minute maximum execution time<br>Memory limitations (up to 10 GB)<br>Temporary storage limitations<br>Data Size Challenges: Processing 15-20 GB of data would likely require complex chunking and orchestration with Lambda, increasing development complexity.<br>Cost Considerations: Provisioned capacity for Lambda functions can be expensive for long-running or resource-intensive workloads compared to Spot Instances.<br>Resource Efficiency: Lambda is optimized for short, event-driven processing rather than large-scale batch computations.<br>AWS Batch with EC2 Spot Instances provides a purpose-built solution for exactly this type of workload - large-scale, interruptible batch processing jobs - at the lowest possible cost, making it the most cost-effective solution that meets all the stated requirements.<br>Sources<br>Use Amazon EC2 Spot best practices for AWS Batch - AWS Batch （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/bestpractice6.html）<br>Running batch jobs at scale with EC2 Spot Instances （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/tutorials/run-batch-jobs-at-scale-with-ec2-spot/）<br>

<br>Option B is the most cost-effective solution for archiving image data to AWS, considering the company's requirements. Using AWS DataSync with a Hyper-V VM on-premises allows for efficient data transfer to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, which is an affordable storage option for long-term archiving. This approach also aligns with the need to retrieve archived data within 1 week, as S3 Glacier Deep Archive provides retrieval options that can meet this requirement. Option A's Instant Retrieval is not necessary for data that is accessed within a week, and Option C's S3 Standard is more expensive for storing large amounts of data before transitioning to Deep Archive. Option D's Tape Gateway is less efficient and more complex for the described use case.<br>Deploy an AWS DataSync agent as a Hyper-V VM on premises. Configure the DataSync agent to copy the batch of files from the NFS on-premises server to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive. After the successful copy, delete the data from the on-premises storage.<br> Why? &nbsp;<br>1. Cost-Effective Storage: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the cheapest storage option for long-term archival (retrieval within 12 hours or more, but the requirement allows for retrieval within 1 week, which fits). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 Standard (Option C) is more expensive for long-term storage, and transitioning to Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day adds complexity. &nbsp;<br>2. Efficient Transfer: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS DataSync is optimized for high-speed data transfer over Direct Connect (10 Gbps). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Running DataSync on-premises as a Hyper-V VM (instead of an EC2 instance) saves costs since the company already has available compute capacity. &nbsp;<br>3. Bandwidth Control & Scheduling: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - DataSync allows bandwidth throttling and scheduling transfers during non-business hours, meeting the requirement. &nbsp;<br>4. No Unnecessary Components: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Tape Gateway (Option D) is overkill since the data is already in files (not tapes). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - GPU-based EC2 (Option A) is unnecessary because no GPU processing is required. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval (Option A) is more expensive than needed (retrieval in milliseconds is not required). &nbsp;<br>

<br>Option B is correct as converting the web-crawling process into an AWS Lambda function would allow for on-demand execution without the need to maintain a fleet of EC2 instances. This would significantly reduce costs when the workload is variable and sporadic. Option E is also correct as storing results in Amazon S3 is a cost-effective solution for storing large amounts of data generated by the web-crawling process. S3 is a scalable and durable storage solution that can handle the output of the crawling process efficiently. Option A is not cost-effective as larger instances are more expensive and do not address the issue of idle time. Options C and D involve using more expensive database services that are not necessary for the use case and do not optimize for cost.<br> Answer: B & E &nbsp;<br>B. Convert the web-crawling process into an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to pull URLs from the SQS queue. &nbsp;<br>E. Modify the web-crawling process to store results in Amazon S3. &nbsp;<br> Why? &nbsp;<br>1. Cost Optimization with AWS Lambda (Option B) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Currently, EC2 t2.micro instances run continuously, leading to idle time when no URLs are in the queue. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Lambda is event-driven, so it only runs when there’s a message in the SQS queue, eliminating idle costs. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Since each crawl takes ≤10 seconds, Lambda fits well within its execution limits. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Lambda scales automatically, removing the need to manage an EC2 fleet. &nbsp;<br>2. Cheaper Storage with Amazon S3 (Option E) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - EFS is expensive for storing large volumes of `.csv` files (charged per GB, plus throughput costs). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 is significantly cheaper for object storage (pay only for storage used, no mounting or throughput fees). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - S3 is highly durable and integrates well with Lambda. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (m5.8xlarge instances): Overkill for this workload (high cost, still runs idle). &nbsp;<br>- C (Neptune): A graph database, unsuitable for `.csv` storage (expensive for this use case). &nbsp;<br>- D (Aurora Serverless): More expensive than S3 for simple `.csv` storage (better for structured queries). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion &nbsp;<br>By using Lambda (B) for compute and S3 (E) for storage, the solution eliminates idle costs and reduces storage expenses, making it the most cost-effective choice. ✅<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>Option C is the correct solution as it addresses both disaster recovery and performance optimization. By creating a read replica of the RDS DB instance in a separate Region, the solution ensures that the finance team can run their queries without impacting the performance of the primary application. Additionally, the use of AMIs for EC2 instances allows for rapid recovery in the event of a disaster, and S3 Cross-Region Replication ensures that the documents stored in S3 are also protected. Option A is less suitable because migrating to DynamoDB would require changes to the application, which is not desired. Option B is not as efficient because it does not address the performance issue during normal operations. Option D is less preferable because it relies on snapshots, which do not provide the same level of real-time replication and availability as a read replica.<br> Answer: C &nbsp;<br>Create a read replica of the RDS DB instance in a separate Region. Instruct the finance team to run queries against the read replica. Create AMIs of the EC2 instances that host the application frontend. Copy the AMIs to the separate Region.

Apply the SCP to the root OU.<br>This solution is the most effective with the least operational overhead for several key reasons:<br>1.Centralized implementation: By applying the SCP to the root OU, it automatically affects all accounts in the organization without requiring access to each individual account.<br>2.Deny-based approach: Using a deny statement with an exception is more secure than an allow-based approach. SCPs use a deny-by-default model, so explicitly denying IAM actions except for administrator roles creates a stronger security boundary.<br>3.Low maintenance: Once implemented, this solution requires minimal ongoing management. The SCP will automatically apply to new accounts added to the organization.<br>4.Preventive control: This approach prevents unauthorized IAM actions before they occur, rather than detecting and responding to them after the fact.<br><br><br>The other options have significant drawbacks:<br>A. Creating an SCP that only allows IAM actions for administrator roles is less effective because SCPs work as permission boundaries (they don't grant permissions, they limit them). An allow-only SCP would need to be carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences and would be more complex to maintain.<br><br><br>B. Using CloudTrail with Lambda would be a detective and reactive approach rather than preventive. This would have much higher operational overhead due to:<br><br><br>Setting up and maintaining the Lambda function<br>Processing CloudTrail logs (which could incur additional costs)<br>Potential latency between when an action occurs and when it's detected<br>The solution would only detect violations after they occur rather than preventing them<br>The SCP approach in option C provides a preventive, organization-wide control that requires minimal maintenance and doesn't require access to individual accounts, making it the solution with the least operational overhead.<br>Sources<br>AWS Identity and Access Management and AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-iam.html）<br>How to implement a read-only service control policy (SCP) for accounts in AWS Organizations | AWS Cloud Operations & Migrations Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/implement-read-only-service-control-policy-in-aws-organizations/）<br>Service control policies (SCPs) - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Option B is the correct solution as it allows for the sharing of the transit gateway with the development account using AWS Resource Access Manager, which supports the ability to automatically accept connections. This approach provides the flexibility for the development team to recreate their connection to the shared services account as needed, meeting the requirement for frequent deletion and recreation of resources. Option A is incorrect because peering is used between VPCs in different accounts, not for connecting to a transit gateway. Option C is incorrect because VPC endpoints do not support automatic acceptance of connections in this context. Option D is overly complex and does not directly address the requirement for transit gateway connectivity.<br>Turn on automatic acceptance for the transit gateway in the shared services account. Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the transit gateway resource in the shared services account with the development account. Accept the resource in the development account. Create a transit gateway attachment in the development account. &nbsp;<br> Why? &nbsp;<br>1. Meets Key Requirements: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Frequent Recreations in Dev Account: The development team can create and delete transit gateway attachments as needed (self-service capability). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Access to Shared Services: AWS RAM allows secure sharing of the transit gateway from the shared services account to the development account. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Automatic Acceptance: Enabling auto-acceptance ensures seamless connectivity without manual approvals. &nbsp;<br>2. Simplified & Scalable: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS RAM is the recommended way to share transit gateways across accounts in an AWS Organization. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No complex scripting (Lambda/EventBridge) is needed (unlike Option D). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No peering (Option A) is required, which is more complex and unnecessary for this use case. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - VPC endpoints (Option C) are not suitable for transit gateway connectivity. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Transit Gateway Peering): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Peering is not needed—RAM sharing is simpler and more efficient. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Peering requires manual acceptance unless auto-accept is configured, but RAM is still the better choice. &nbsp;<br>- C (VPC Endpoint): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- VPC endpoints are for private AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.), not transit gateway connections. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This does not provide the required networking setup. &nbsp;<br>- D (EventBridge + Lambda + Network Manager): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overly complex—RAM already provides a native, automated way to share transit gateways. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Network Manager is for monitoring, not resource sharing. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Launch a Windows Amazon EC2 instance. Install the Migration Evaluator agentless collector on the EC2 instance. Configure Migration Evaluator to generate the TCO report.<br>This solution will meet the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Non-intrusive Data Collection: The Migration Evaluator agentless collector can gather information from the on-premises VMs that have SNMP enabled without requiring any additional software installation on those VMs. This satisfies the requirement that the company cannot install additional software on the VMs.<br>TCO Report Generation: Migration Evaluator (formerly TSO Logic) is specifically designed to generate total cost of ownership (TCO) reports for migrations to AWS. It can analyze the current on-premises environment, including Microsoft workloads, and provide detailed cost comparisons between on-premises and AWS environments.<br>Utilization of Existing Infrastructure: The solution leverages the existing AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to the VPC, allowing the EC2 instance running the Migration Evaluator agentless collector to communicate with the on-premises environment.<br>No Additional On-premises VMs: Since the collector is installed on an EC2 instance in AWS, there's no need to add more VMs in the on-premises data center, which the company cannot do according to the requirements.<br>Microsoft Workload Support: Migration Evaluator has specific capabilities for assessing Microsoft workloads, including analyzing server profiles, utilization data, and Microsoft licensing considerations.<br>While the Migration Evaluator itself doesn't directly integrate with AWS Migration Hub for automatic import of discovery data, it can collect the necessary information to generate the TCO report, which is the primary requirement stated in the question. The EC2 instance with the agentless collector can communicate with the on-premises VMs via SNMP over the existing Site-to-Site VPN connection.<br>This solution provides the most efficient way to generate a TCO report for the migration without installing additional software on the VMs or adding new VMs to the on-premises environment, making it the best match for the stated requirements.<br>Sources<br>Creating a directional business case - AWS Prescriptive Guidance（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/application-portfolio-assessment-guide/directional-business-case.html） <br>Seeking Advice on Utilizing Migration Evaluator for AWS Migration Business Cases | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU11RsGVWsQpOYHehhrbHpPA/seeking-advice-on-utilizing-migration-evaluator-for-aws-migration-business-cases）<br>

To meet the company's requirements for serving game assets from the closest AWS Region and providing failover capability, the best solution is:<br><br><br>D. Create an Amazon Route 53 health check for each ALB. Create a Route 53 latency alias record pointing to the two ALBs. Set the Evaluate Target Health value to Yes.<br><br><br>Here's why this solution is the most appropriate:<br>1. Latency-based routing: Route 53 latency routing allows you to direct traffic to the Region with the lowest latency for each user, ensuring game assets are fetched from the closest Region.<br>2. Health checks: By creating health checks for each ALB, Route 53 can detect if a Region's assets become unavailable.<br>3. Failover capability: Setting "Evaluate Target Health" to Yes enables automatic failover. If the closest Region's ALB fails the health check, Route 53 will route traffic to the other Region.<br>4. Alias records: Using alias records allows you to route traffic directly to ALBs, which is more efficient and cost-effective than using non-alias records.<br>This solution provides several benefits:<br>- Improved performance by serving assets from the closest Region<br>- Automatic failover for high availability<br>- Cost-effective implementation using native AWS services<br>To implement this solution:<br><br><br>1. Create a Route 53 health check for each ALB to monitor their availability.<br>2. Set up a latency-based routing policy in Route 53.<br>3. Create alias records for each ALB, associating them with the latency-based routing policy.<br>4. Enable "Evaluate Target Health" for each record.<br><br><br>Remember to configure appropriate security groups and network ACLs for your ALBs and EC2 instances to ensure secure communication.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Update the VPC flow log configuration to store the files in Apache Parquet format. Specify hourly partitions for the log files.<br>This solution will provide the largest performance improvement for the following reasons:<br>Columnar Storage Format: Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format that significantly improves query performance in Athena compared to text log formats. When querying VPC flow logs, you typically only need specific columns (like source IP, destination IP, or time ranges), and Parquet allows Athena to read only the required columns rather than scanning the entire dataset.<br>Compression Efficiency: Parquet provides better compression than gzip-compressed text files, typically reducing storage space by about 20%. This addresses the requirement to reduce storage space while also improving query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.<br>Hourly Partitioning: Partitioning the data by hour creates a time-based directory structure that allows Athena to skip irrelevant data blocks during queries. When the security engineer runs time-based queries (which are common for log analysis), Athena will only scan the partitions that match the time range in the query, dramatically reducing the amount of data processed.<br>Predicate Pushdown: Parquet format enables predicate pushdown, which pushes filtering operations closer to the data source. This means filtering happens before data is loaded into memory, significantly reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.<br>Long-term Scalability: As the company needs to retain logs indefinitely, the performance benefits of Parquet format and partitioning become increasingly important over time as the dataset grows.<br>Option D (creating a new Athena workgroup without data usage control limits and using Athena engine version 2) would provide some performance improvements but doesn't address the fundamental issue of inefficient data format and organization. While Athena engine version 2 is faster than version 1, the performance gains would be much smaller compared to the optimization of the data format itself.<br>The Parquet format with hourly partitioning directly addresses both requirements: improving query performance and reducing storage space. This approach provides a more sustainable solution as the volume of log data continues to grow indefinitely.<br>Sources<br>Create tables for flow logs in Apache Parquet format - Amazon Athena （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/vpc-flow-logs-parquet.html）<br>Create tables for flow logs in Apache Parquet format using partition projection - Amazon Athena （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/vpc-flow-logs-partition-projection-parquet-example.html）<br>Monitoring and optimizing the data lake environment - Storage Best Practices for Data and Analytics Applications （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-data-lakes/monitoring-optimizing-data-lake-environment.html）<br>

Advertise the VPC prefixes from the Direct Connect gateway to the on-premises network over the transit VIF.<br>These two steps are essential for establishing connectivity between the on-premises infrastructure and VPC resources over a transit VIF using the Direct Connect connection. Here's why these are the correct choices:<br>Advertise the on-premises network prefixes over the transit VIF (Option B):<br>This step is crucial because it informs the AWS network (specifically the Direct Connect gateway and transit gateway) about the reachable destinations in the on-premises network.<br>Without this advertisement, the transit gateway wouldn't know which traffic should be routed to the on-premises network via the Direct Connect gateway.<br>This enables traffic from VPC resources to reach the on-premises infrastructure by providing the necessary routing information.<br>Advertise the VPC prefixes from the Direct Connect gateway to the on-premises network over the transit VIF (Option C):<br>This step is equally important as it informs the on-premises network about the reachable AWS VPC destinations.<br>Without this advertisement, the on-premises routers wouldn't know which traffic should be sent over the Direct Connect connection to reach VPC resources.<br>This enables traffic from the on-premises infrastructure to reach the VPC resources by providing the necessary routing information.<br>The other options are not required for the specified setup:<br>Option A (Update the 1 Gbps Direct Connect connection to 10 Gbps): The existing 1 Gbps connection is sufficient for the setup. While increasing bandwidth might improve performance, it's not a requirement for establishing connectivity.<br>Option D (Update the Direct Connect connection's MACsec encryption mode attribute to must_encrypt) and Option E (Associate a MACsec Connection Key Name/Connectivity Association Key (CKN/CAK) pair): These options relate to MACsec encryption, which is only applicable for 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps Direct Connect connections at select locations.

<br>The company needs a scalable, highly available, and cost-effective solution for deploying firewall appliances while maintaining compliance. Here's why these choices are the best: &nbsp;<br> A. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in the centralized networking account. Set up an endpoint service that uses AWS PrivateLink. &nbsp;<br>- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) is specifically designed for deploying third-party virtual appliances (like firewalls) in a scalable way. &nbsp;<br>- It integrates with AWS PrivateLink, allowing member accounts to securely route traffic through the centralized firewalls. &nbsp;<br>- This is more efficient than a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for this use case because GWLB handles traffic inspection and forwarding at scale. &nbsp;<br> C. Create an Auto Scaling group and a launch template that uses the new script as user data to configure the firewall appliances. Create a target group that uses the instance target type. &nbsp;<br>- Auto Scaling ensures high availability and horizontal scaling of firewall instances. &nbsp;<br>- The launch template with user data automates the configuration of new instances, eliminating manual setup. &nbsp;<br>- The target group (instance type) registers the firewall instances with the GWLB for traffic distribution. &nbsp;<br> F. Create VPC endpoints in the centralized networking account. Update the route tables in each member account to point to the VPC endpoints. &nbsp;<br>- VPC endpoints (Gateway Load Balancer endpoints, GWLBE) allow member accounts to route traffic to the centralized firewalls securely. &nbsp;<br>- Updating route tables in member accounts ensures all traffic passes through the firewall for inspection. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Network Load Balancer + PrivateLink): NLB is not optimized for firewall traffic inspection like GWLB. &nbsp;<br>- D (AWS Launch Wizard + IP target type): Launch Wizard is unnecessary here, and IP target type is less efficient than instance target type for this scenario. &nbsp;<br>- E (VPC endpoints in member accounts): The endpoints should be in the centralized account, not member accounts, for proper traffic flow. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A, C, F provide the most scalable, automated, and cost-effective solution while maintaining compliance. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Create an RDS proxy by using the Lambda console. Modify the Lambda function to use the proxy endpoint.<br>This solution will best optimize the application's performance for the following reasons:<br>Connection Pooling: During the flash sale, the sudden increase in API calls led to a significant increase in Lambda invocations, which in turn created many database connections. RDS Proxy provides efficient connection pooling, allowing multiple Lambda invocations to share a smaller pool of database connections rather than each creating its own connection.<br>Reduced Database Load: The high CPU utilization on the DB instance was likely caused by the overhead of establishing and managing numerous database connections. RDS Proxy reduces this overhead by maintaining persistent connections to the database and reusing them across multiple Lambda invocations.<br>Improved Scalability: RDS Proxy can handle connection surges during flash sales by queuing connection requests when the database reaches its connection limit, preventing connection errors and allowing the application to scale more effectively.<br>Minimal Code Changes: Implementing RDS Proxy requires only changing the database endpoint in the Lambda function, making it a relatively simple solution to implement compared to more complex connection management logic.<br>Automatic Failover Support: RDS Proxy provides seamless handling of database failovers, which improves the overall reliability of the application during high-traffic events.<br>Option D (modifying the Lambda function to connect outside the handler and check for existing connections) would provide some benefits by reusing connections within the same Lambda container instance. However, this approach has limitations:<br>It only works within a single Lambda container instance, and during high-traffic events, many new container instances would still be created, each establishing its own connection.<br>It requires more complex code changes and careful management of connection timeouts and error handling.<br>It doesn't address the fundamental issue of too many simultaneous connections to the database during traffic spikes.<br>RDS Proxy is specifically designed to address the exact issues observed during the flash sale: high numbers of Lambda invocations creating too many database connections and causing high CPU utilization on the database. By implementing RDS Proxy, the solutions architect can optimize the application's performance for future flash sales with minimal code changes and maximum effectiveness.<br>Sources<br>Which is preferred, Lambda-&gt;RDS Proxy-&gt;RDS or Lambda-&gt;RDS? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU1U72jyYWTcisPaIF3CSSqg/which-is-preferred-lambda-rds-proxy-rds-or-lambda-rds）<br>Amazon RDS Proxy - Amazon Relational Database Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html）<br>Reuse of database connections by a lambda. | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUABFESymvR1aJ7MGijjp5SA/reuse-of-database-connections-by-a-lambda）<br>RDS Proxy causing a consistent increase in DB Connections from Lambda | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QU2hiJKCLUQcq5ApSro0ixMQ/rds-proxy-causing-a-consistent-increase-in-db-connections-from-lambda）<br>

<br>The company needs an event-driven, serverless architecture that provides near-real-time analytics. Here’s why Option C is the best choice: &nbsp;<br> 1. Microservices on Amazon EKS with AWS Fargate &nbsp;<br>- Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is ideal for running microservices in a scalable way. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Fargate provides serverless compute, eliminating the need to manage EC2 instances. &nbsp;<br>- This setup ensures automatic scaling and cost efficiency for the order-processing applications. &nbsp;<br> 2. Serverless Databases (Aurora MySQL & Redshift Serverless) &nbsp;<br>- Amazon Aurora Serverless (MySQL-compatible) scales automatically, reducing management overhead for the retail database. &nbsp;<br>- Amazon Redshift Serverless is optimized for near-real-time analytics and scales based on demand. &nbsp;<br>- Both databases support event-driven updates, eliminating the need for weekly ETL jobs. &nbsp;<br> 3. Event-Driven Data Flow with Amazon EventBridge &nbsp;<br>- Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that can route events from different sources (e.g., order processing, returns) to microservices and the analytics database. &nbsp;<br>- This enables real-time data processing instead of relying on batch ETL jobs. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (ECS + Neptune + SQS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Amazon Neptune is a graph database, not suitable for OLAP analytics. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- SQS is for queuing, not real-time event processing. &nbsp;<br>- B (Auto Scaling EC2 + Aurora MySQL + SNS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Still relies on EC2 instances, not fully serverless. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- SNS is for pub/sub messaging, not as flexible as EventBridge for event-driven workflows. &nbsp;<br>- D (AppStream 2.0 + IoT Core): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AppStream 2.0 is for virtual desktop streaming, not microservices. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- AWS IoT Core is for IoT devices, not retail order processing. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option C provides a fully serverless, event-driven, and scalable solution with real-time analytics, meeting all requirements. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create a new CloudTrail trail in the organization's management account. Configure the trail to log all events for all AWS accounts in the organization.<br>This solution is the most operationally efficient for the following reasons:<br>Centralized Management: Creating an organization trail in the management account provides a single point of management for CloudTrail across all accounts in the organization. This significantly reduces the operational overhead compared to managing individual trails in each account.<br>Automatic Coverage for New Accounts: When new AWS accounts are added to the organization, they are automatically included in the organization trail without any additional configuration. This is particularly important since the company plans to "add accounts as needed."<br>Consistent Logging: An organization trail ensures uniform event logging across all accounts, providing a comprehensive and consistent audit trail for the entire organization.<br>No Custom Code Required: Unlike the Lambda function approach, this solution uses native AWS functionality and doesn't require writing, testing, and maintaining custom code.<br>No Scheduling or Monitoring Overhead: There's no need to set up and monitor scheduled EventBridge rules or Lambda functions, eliminating potential points of failure.<br>Immediate Activation: The organization trail begins logging events for new accounts as soon as they're added to the organization, without any delay or manual intervention.<br>Cost Efficiency: While both solutions incur CloudTrail and S3 storage costs, the Lambda function approach would add additional costs for Lambda executions and potential API call charges.<br>Option A (using a Lambda function with EventBridge) is less efficient because:<br>It introduces unnecessary complexity with custom code<br>It requires ongoing maintenance of the Lambda function<br>There could be a delay between account creation and CloudTrail enablement<br>It might miss newly created accounts if they're added between scheduled Lambda executions<br>It creates additional points of failure in the logging system<br>The organization trail approach (Option B) is specifically designed for multi-account environments in AWS Organizations and represents the AWS recommended best practice for enabling CloudTrail across an organization.<br>Sources<br>CloudTrail concepts - AWS CloudTrail （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html）<br>AWS CloudTrail and AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-cloudtrail.html）<br>Working with CloudTrail trails - AWS CloudTrail（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-trails.html） <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Create an AWS Client VPN endpoint. Create an AD Connector directory for integration with AD DS. Enable MFA for AD Connector. Use AWS Client VPN to establish a VPN connection.<br>This solution meets the requirements for the following reasons:<br>Remote Access Requirement: The company has multiple engineers working remotely who need access to internal, non-public services deployed in a VPC. AWS Client VPN is specifically designed for this scenario, allowing individual users to establish secure connections to AWS resources from any location.<br>VPN Access Requirement: The security policy states that all internal services must be accessible through a VPN. AWS Client VPN provides this secure tunnel for remote users to access resources within the VPC.<br>Active Directory Integration: The company is running AD DS on an EC2 instance. AD Connector provides a way to integrate AWS Client VPN with the existing Active Directory infrastructure, allowing users to authenticate using their existing AD credentials.<br>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirement: The security policy mandates MFA for VPN access. AD Connector supports enabling MFA, which adds an additional layer of security beyond just username and password authentication.<br>Scalability: As the company has multiple engineers working remotely, this solution scales well to accommodate individual user connections without requiring additional hardware or complex configurations.<br>Option A (AWS Site-to-Site VPN with WorkSpaces) is not appropriate for this scenario because:<br>Site-to-Site VPN is designed to connect entire networks (like an on-premises data center to AWS), not individual remote users. It would require remote engineers to first connect to a central location before accessing AWS resources.<br>Amazon WorkSpaces is a virtual desktop solution, not a VPN solution. While it can be used with MFA, it doesn't fulfill the requirement that "all internal services must be accessible through a VPN."<br>This approach would be more complex and costly than necessary for the given requirements.<br>AWS Client VPN with AD Connector and MFA provides the most direct and appropriate solution for enabling remote engineers to securely access internal services in the VPC while meeting all the security requirements specified in the scenario.<br>Sources<br>Active Directory authentication in Client VPN - AWS Client VPN （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/ad.html）<br>Enabling multi-factor authentication for AWS Managed Microsoft AD - AWS Directory Service （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_mfa.html）<br>Connect on-prem AD to VPC, is it a AD connector required? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUNPG4paiiRJWzFobuUtbyTQ/connect-on-prem-ad-to-vpc-is-it-a-ad-connector-required）<br>

<br>The company needs a scalable, highly available, and low-maintenance solution on AWS. Here’s why Option A, C, E is the best choice: &nbsp;<br> A. Refactor the frontend to use Amazon S3 + CloudFront &nbsp;<br>- Amazon S3 is ideal for hosting static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) with high durability and scalability. &nbsp;<br>- Amazon CloudFront (CDN) improves performance by caching content globally, reducing load on backend servers. &nbsp;<br>- This reduces the need for Apache web servers to serve static files, improving scalability. &nbsp;<br> C. Rehost the Java application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Auto Scaling &nbsp;<br>- Elastic Beanstalk automates deployment, scaling, and monitoring of Java applications. &nbsp;<br>- Auto Scaling ensures the application can handle traffic spikes during promotions. &nbsp;<br>- Since the Java app is monolithic, rehosting (lift-and-shift) is faster than refactoring into microservices. &nbsp;<br> E. Replatform PostgreSQL to Amazon Aurora with Auto Scaling for read replicas &nbsp;<br>- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is fully compatible but offers better performance, scalability, and reliability. &nbsp;<br>- Aurora Auto Scaling automatically adds read replicas during high traffic, preventing database overload. &nbsp;<br>- This solves the issue of read capacity limits during promotions. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Rehost Apache on EC2 + EFS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Still requires managing EC2 instances (not fully serverless). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- EFS is overkill for static assets (S3 + CloudFront is better). &nbsp;<br>- D (Refactor Java into Docker + Fargate): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- While Fargate is serverless, refactoring a monolithic Java app into containers is time-consuming and not necessary for immediate scalability. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Elastic Beanstalk (Option C) provides a simpler, faster solution. &nbsp;<br>- F (Rehost PostgreSQL on a larger EC2 instance): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Vertical scaling (bigger EC2 instance) is not as scalable as Aurora with read replicas (Option E). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Requires manual intervention to scale, unlike Aurora Auto Scaling. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A, C, E provides the best balance of scalability, minimal operational effort, and AWS-managed services to handle future promotions. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Activate Amazon Inspector to scan the EKS nodes and the ECR repository.<br>This solution will meet the requirement for continuous security vulnerability scanning with the least operational overhead for the following reasons:<br>Purpose-Built for Vulnerability Scanning: Amazon Inspector is specifically designed for automated vulnerability management and continuous scanning of AWS resources, including EKS nodes and ECR repositories.<br>Native Container Support: Amazon Inspector has built-in capabilities to scan container images in ECR repositories for software vulnerabilities, identifying security issues in the container images that will be deployed to the EKS cluster.<br>EKS Node Scanning: Amazon Inspector can automatically scan the EC2 instances in the AWS managed node group for the EKS cluster, detecting operating system vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.<br>Minimal Configuration: Once activated, Amazon Inspector automatically discovers supported resources and begins scanning them without requiring extensive setup or configuration.<br>Continuous Monitoring: Amazon Inspector provides continuous, automated scanning that detects new vulnerabilities as they emerge, meeting the company's requirement for continuous security scanning.<br>Low Operational Overhead: As a fully managed service, Amazon Inspector requires minimal ongoing maintenance and automatically updates its vulnerability database, reducing the operational burden on the company's team.<br>Option A (AWS Security Hub) would not be the optimal choice for this specific requirement because:<br>Security Hub is primarily an aggregation and management service that collects security findings from various AWS services, including Amazon Inspector.<br>Security Hub itself doesn't perform the actual vulnerability scanning of EKS nodes and ECR repositories - it would still rely on other services like Amazon Inspector to perform the actual scans.<br>Setting up Security Hub to scan these resources would require additional configuration and integration with other services, increasing the operational overhead.<br>By activating Amazon Inspector, the company can implement continuous vulnerability scanning for both their EKS cluster nodes and ECR repository with minimal setup and ongoing maintenance, making it the solution with the least operational overhead that meets the security requirement.<br>Sources<br>Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR - Amazon ECR （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html）<br>Automated Vulnerability Management - Amazon Inspector Features - AWS （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/inspector/features/）<br>Amazon Inspector enhances container security by mapping Amazon ECR images to running containers | AWS News Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws/amazon-inspector-enhances-container-security-by-mapping-amazon-ecr-images-to-running-containers/）<br>

<br>The company needs to improve reliability by isolating the waiting room traffic from the ticketing service while efficiently routing users based on their JWT. Here’s why Option C is the best choice: &nbsp;<br> 1. Separate ECS Service for the Waiting Room + Independent Scaling &nbsp;<br>- Isolating the waiting room into its own ECS service prevents it from consuming resources needed for ticket sales. &nbsp;<br>- Independent scaling allows the waiting room to handle high loads without affecting the ticketing service. &nbsp;<br> 2. CloudFront Function for JWT-Based Routing &nbsp;<br>- CloudFront Functions (edge compute) can inspect the JWT and route requests before they hit the origin. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- If the JWT allows ticket purchasing → forward to the ticketing service. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- If the user must wait → forward to the waiting room service. &nbsp;<br>- This reduces load on the ECS cluster by offloading routing logic to CloudFront. &nbsp;<br> 3. Why This is the Most Reliable Solution &nbsp;<br>- No unnecessary migration (unlike Options B & D, which suggest moving to EKS). &nbsp;<br>- Serverless routing (CloudFront Functions) is low-latency and scalable. &nbsp;<br>- Decouples the waiting room from the ticketing service, ensuring ticket sales remain stable. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A (Separate ECS service but no CloudFront routing): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Still relies on the ticketing service to route traffic, which adds unnecessary load. &nbsp;<br>- B (Move to EKS + StatefulSet): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Overkill—ECS is sufficient, and StatefulSet is unnecessary for this stateless app. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- No CloudFront optimization, so routing still happens at the cluster level. &nbsp;<br>- D (Move to EKS + App Mesh + mTLS): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Complexity is unnecessary—CloudFront Functions provide a simpler, more scalable solution. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- mTLS and App Mesh add overhead without solving the core issue (waiting room load). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option C provides the most reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution by: &nbsp;<br>✅ Isolating the waiting room (separate ECS service + scaling). &nbsp;<br>✅ Offloading routing logic to CloudFront (JWT inspection at the edge). &nbsp;<br>✅ Minimizing changes (no migration to EKS). &nbsp;<br>

<br>The issue occurs because the trust policy in the parent account’s role must explicitly allow the EC2 instance’s instance profile (or its role) in the child account to assume it. When the role was recreated in the CloudFormation template, the trust relationship was not updated to include the new role’s ARN (even if the name is the same, the ARN changes when recreated). &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is Correct: &nbsp;<br>1. The root cause is the trust policy in the parent account’s role. &nbsp;<br>2. The existing `sts:AssumeRole` statement must be updated to include the new role ARN from the child account. &nbsp;<br>3. This ensures the EC2 instance’s instance profile (or its role) can still assume the parent account’s role. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Add a statement allowing the child account’s root principal): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Security risk: Granting `sts:AssumeRole` to the entire child account’s root principal is overly permissive. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Best practice: Only allow specific roles (like the EC2 instance profile) to assume the role. &nbsp;<br>- C (Specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This is irrelevant—the issue is not about CloudFormation permissions, but about IAM trust relationships. &nbsp;<br>- D (Specify both `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Again, this is not the issue—CloudFormation can create the role, but the trust policy must be manually updated in the parent account. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>The trust policy in the parent account must be updated to allow the newly recreated role in the child account to assume it. This is a manual step because CloudFormation cannot modify IAM policies in another account. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
Based on the company's requirements for their massive multiplayer game's leaderboard, the solution that will meet these requirements with the least operational overhead is:<br>B. Create an Amazon MemoryDB for Redis cluster in Multi-AZ mode. Configure the application to interact with the primary node.<br>Here's why this solution is the most suitable:<br>1. Performance: Amazon MemoryDB for Redis offers microsecond read latencies and single-digit millisecond write latencies, which meets the game's leaderboard requirements.<br>2. Scalability: MemoryDB can handle up to 160 million transactions per second (TPS) per cluster, which is suitable for a massive multiplayer game.<br>3. Data persistence: MemoryDB ensures data durability through a Multi-AZ transactional log, allowing data to persist for further analytical processing through a data pipeline.<br>4. High availability: Multi-AZ mode provides automatic failover and node recovery, ensuring that the system can accept writes in less than a minute if a primary node failure occurs.<br>5. Data size: MemoryDB supports up to 100 TB of storage per cluster, which is more than sufficient for the single-digit terabyte datasets mentioned.<br>6. Operational overhead: As a fully managed service, MemoryDB requires minimal operational overhead compared to self-managed solutions.<br>7. Compatibility: MemoryDB supports Redis data structures and APIs, making it easy to integrate with existing game applications.<br>To implement this solution:<br>1. Create a MemoryDB cluster in Multi-AZ mode within your preferred AWS region.<br>2. Configure the cluster with appropriate node types and settings to handle your expected workload.<br>3. Set up encryption at rest and in transit for enhanced security.<br>4. Implement proper access controls using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACLs).<br>5. Configure your game application to interact with the primary node of the MemoryDB cluster for both reads and writes.<br>6. Set up monitoring and alerting using Amazon CloudWatch to track the cluster's performance and health.<br>For data pipeline integration:<br>1. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to capture and stream data from MemoryDB to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.<br>2. Utilize Amazon Glue for ETL processes to prepare the data for analysis.<br>3. Consider using Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena for analytical processing of the persisted data.<br>Remember to review the AWS documentation for the most up-to-date information on MemoryDB features, best practices, and any limitations. Additionally, always test your configuration in a non-production environment before deploying to production.<br>Sources<br>[1] [Managing clusters - Amazon MemoryDB for Redis] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/clusters.html)<br>[3] [Launch a scalable serverless data pipeline to ingest, store, and analyze telemetry data generated from games and services - Game Analytics Pipeline] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/game-analytics-pipeline/welcome.html)<br>[6] [Features of MemoryDB - Amazon MemoryDB] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/servicename-feature-overview.html)<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The question describes a scenario where a company needs to allocate and visualize AWS costs by business units using the existing `BusinessUnit` tag. Here's why option A is the best solution: &nbsp;<br>1. Cost Allocation Tag in Management Account: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The `BusinessUnit` tag already exists on resources. Activating it as a cost allocation tag in the management account ensures that AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) will include this tag for cost allocation. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Cost allocation tags only need to be activated once in the management account (for organization-wide tagging). &nbsp;<br>2. AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The CUR provides detailed cost and usage data, including tags. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Configuring the CUR in the management account with an S3 bucket as the destination ensures consolidated billing data is available for analysis. &nbsp;<br>3. Amazon Athena & QuickSight for Analysis & Visualization: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Amazon Athena can query the CUR data stored in S3. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Amazon QuickSight is a powerful visualization tool that integrates with Athena to create dashboards for business unit cost tracking. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B: Incorrect because CloudWatch is not designed for cost visualization (it’s for monitoring). Also, cost allocation tags don’t need to be activated in each member account. &nbsp;<br>- C: Incorrect because creating separate CURs in each member account is unnecessary and complicates cost aggregation. CloudWatch is not the right tool for cost visualization. &nbsp;<br>- D: Incorrect because activating cost allocation tags in each member account is redundant, and managing multiple CURs is inefficient. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A is the correct choice because it efficiently centralizes cost allocation tag activation, uses CUR for detailed reporting, and leverages Athena + QuickSight for visualization. &nbsp;<br>

<br>The problem describes two key issues: &nbsp;<br>1. DynamoDB Throttling (`ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`) → Solution: Increase write capacity (A) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The DynamoDB table is unable to handle the increased write load, leading to throttling errors. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Increasing write capacity units (WCUs) will allow DynamoDB to handle more write requests per second. &nbsp;<br>2. Lambda Throttling (`TooManyRequestsException`) & Slow Processing → Solution: Stream data via Kinesis (D) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Lambda is struggling with high concurrency and long execution times (1-2 minutes). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Instead of processing each request individually via API Gateway → Lambda, streaming data into Kinesis allows: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Batching of records for more efficient processing. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Better scaling (Kinesis can handle high throughput). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Reduced Lambda invocations (processing multiple records per invocation). &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Increase Lambda memory): While this might speed up individual executions, it doesn’t solve throttling or DynamoDB issues. &nbsp;<br>- C (Increase payload size): This would worsen Lambda execution time and DynamoDB throttling. &nbsp;<br>- E (SQS FIFO queue): FIFO queues have lower throughput (300 msg/sec) and aren’t ideal for high-volume IoT data. Kinesis (D) is better for streaming. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A (Increase DynamoDB WCUs) and D (Use Kinesis for batching) are the best solutions to resolve both DynamoDB throttling and Lambda scaling issues. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Create a connection alias in the primary Region and in the failover Region. Associate the connection aliases with a directory in each Region. Create a Route 53 failover routing policy. Set Evaluate Target Health to Yes.<br>This solution provides the most effective high availability configuration for Amazon WorkSpaces across two AWS Regions for the following reasons:<br>Complete Regional Independence: By creating connection aliases in both the primary and failover Regions and associating each with its own directory, you establish fully independent WorkSpaces environments in each Region. This ensures that if one Region experiences an outage, the other can continue to operate without dependency on the affected Region.<br>Automated Health-Based Routing: The Route 53 failover routing policy with "Evaluate Target Health" set to Yes actively monitors the health of your WorkSpaces environment. If the primary Region becomes unavailable or unhealthy, Route 53 will automatically redirect users to the failover Region without requiring manual intervention.<br>True Disaster Recovery: This configuration provides genuine disaster recovery capabilities, as users can be redirected to a completely functional WorkSpaces environment in the failover Region if the primary Region experiences issues.<br>Minimal Downtime: The automatic failover mechanism ensures that users experience minimal disruption during a regional outage, as they are quickly redirected to the healthy Region.<br>Option B (creating connection aliases in both Regions but associating them with a directory only in the primary Region and using a multivalue answer routing policy) is less effective because:<br>Single Point of Failure: Having the directory only in the primary Region creates a dependency that could prevent the failover Region from functioning if the primary Region becomes unavailable.<br>No Health-Based Routing: The multivalue answer routing policy doesn't consider the health of the endpoints. It simply returns multiple values in a random order, which doesn't guarantee that users will be directed to the available Region during an outage.<br>Inconsistent User Experience: Without health checks, some users might be directed to the unavailable Region, resulting in connection failures and a poor user experience.<br>The solution in option A follows AWS best practices for creating a highly available WorkSpaces deployment across multiple Regions, providing both redundancy and automated failover capabilities to ensure business continuity.<br>Sources<br>Amazon WorkSpaces FAQs | Persistent Desktop Virtualization （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/workspaces-family/workspaces/faqs/）<br>Business continuity for WorkSpaces Personal - Amazon WorkSpaces （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/business-continuity.html）<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html#cross-region-redirection-associate-connection-aliases<br>

The company is looking for a solution that provides an initial assessment of their on-premises environment, visualizes application dependencies, and offers a report with an assessment, all with minimal operational overhead. Let's evaluate the options:<br><br><br>A. Install the AWS Application Discovery Agent on each on-premises VM. After the data collection period ends, use AWS Migration Hub to view the application dependencies. Download the Quick insights assessment report from Migration Hub.<br>   - This option is straightforward and uses a single agent for data collection. AWS Migration Hub integrates with the AWS Application Discovery Service to provide a visualization of application dependencies and an assessment report with minimal effort.<br><br><br>B. Install the Migration Evaluator Collector on each on-premises VM. After the data collection period ends, use Migration Evaluator to view the application dependencies. Download and export the discovered server list from Migration Evaluator. Upload the list to Amazon QuickSight. When the QuickSight report is generated, download the Quick Insights assessment report.<br>   - This option involves additional steps, such as exporting and uploading server lists to Amazon QuickSight, which adds operational overhead.<br><br><br>C. Set up the AWS Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector in the on-premises environment. After the data collection period ends, use AWS Migration Hub to view the application dependencies. Export the discovered server list from Application Discovery Service. Upload the list to Migration Evaluator. When the Migration Evaluator report is generated, download the Quick Insights assessment.<br>   - This option is more complex because it involves setting up an agentless collector and additional steps to upload the server list to Migration Evaluator.<br><br><br>D.

Prevents DoS attacks, checks for vulnerabilities, and guards against common exploits. &nbsp;<br>Option C provides the most complete and accurate approach: &nbsp;<br>- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Protects the API Gateway API from common web exploits (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and helps mitigate DoS attacks. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- *Note: AWS WAF cannot be directly applied to the legacy EC2 API (since it’s not behind an ALB, CloudFront, or API Gateway).* &nbsp;<br>- Amazon Inspector: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Scans the legacy EC2 instance for vulnerabilities (OS/app-level misconfigurations, CVEs). &nbsp;<br>- Amazon GuardDuty: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Monitors for malicious activity (e.g., unusual API access patterns, brute force attempts) but does not block traffic directly (it provides threat detection, not enforcement). &nbsp;<br> Why Not Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- A: Incorrect because AWS WAF cannot protect the legacy EC2 API (unless it’s behind a supported service like ALB/CloudFront). &nbsp;<br>- B: Incorrect because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Inspector cannot analyze API Gateway (it’s for EC2, ECR, Lambda, etc., not managed services). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- GuardDuty cannot block traffic (only detects threats; enforcement requires integration with other services). &nbsp;<br>- D: Incorrect because: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Inspector does not "protect" (it only assesses vulnerabilities). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- GuardDuty cannot block traffic directly (same issue as B). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>C is the correct choice because it: &nbsp;<br>✔ Uses AWS WAF for API Gateway (protection against exploits/DoS). &nbsp;<br>✔ Uses Inspector for legacy EC2 (vulnerability assessment). &nbsp;<br>✔ Uses GuardDuty for monitoring (threat detection). &nbsp;<br>

<br>The main issues during the sale event were: &nbsp;<br>1. Database connection failures due to high Lambda concurrency overwhelming the RDS MySQL database. &nbsp;<br>2. Increased API latency due to Lambda cold starts and connection management overhead. &nbsp;<br> Why Option B is the Best Solution? &nbsp;<br>- RDS Proxy helps manage database connections efficiently by pooling and reusing connections, preventing exhaustion when Lambda scales up. &nbsp;<br>- Secrets Manager securely stores database credentials, which RDS Proxy integrates with. &nbsp;<br>- Provisioned Concurrency reduces Lambda cold starts, improving latency during traffic bursts. &nbsp;<br>- This solution requires minimal code changes—only updating the Lambda functions to point to the RDS Proxy endpoint. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Not Ideal? &nbsp;<br>- A: While moving the connection outside the handler and using provisioned concurrency helps, it doesn’t solve the RDS connection exhaustion issue. &nbsp;<br>- C: Increasing `max_connections` in RDS may help, but it doesn’t efficiently manage connection pooling like RDS Proxy. Reserved concurrency (unlike provisioned concurrency) doesn’t prevent cold starts. &nbsp;<br>- D: Reserved concurrency limits Lambda scaling, which is counterproductive during traffic bursts. Provisioned concurrency (as in B) is the correct choice for reducing latency. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>B is the best solution because it combines RDS Proxy (for connection management) and provisioned concurrency (to reduce latency) with minimal changes. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">B</span>
<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Enable the private DNS option on the VPC attributes.<br>This is the correct solution because:<br>The problem described is that service names are resolving to public IP addresses instead of private IP addresses, even though interface endpoints have been created. This indicates a DNS resolution issue.<br>When you create interface endpoints to AWS services, by default they come with their own endpoint-specific DNS names that resolve to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in your VPC. However, applications typically use the standard public DNS names of AWS services (like s3.amazonaws.com).<br>To make the standard public DNS names of AWS services resolve to the private IP addresses of your interface endpoints, you need to enable the private DNS option. This creates a private hosted zone in Route 53 that overrides the default public DNS resolution within your VPC.<br>When the private DNS option is enabled, requests from within your VPC to the standard AWS service DNS names will resolve to the private IP addresses of your interface endpoints, allowing your internal applications to connect to AWS services using private IP addresses as required by the company policy.<br>The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:<br>A. Updating the subnet route table with a route to the interface endpoint - Interface endpoints don't require specific routes in the route table. They work at the DNS level by resolving service names to private IP addresses.<br>C. Configuring the security group on the interface endpoint - While security groups are important for controlling access to interface endpoints, they don't affect DNS resolution. The issue described is about DNS resolution, not access control.<br>D. Configuring an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone with a conditional forwarder - This is a more complex solution than necessary. Enabling the private DNS option automatically creates the required private hosted zone with the correct DNS records.<br>By enabling the private DNS option, the solutions architect will ensure that AWS service names resolve to the private IP addresses of the interface endpoints, allowing internal applications to connect to AWS services using private IP addresses as required by the company policy.<br>Sources<br>Centralized access to VPC private endpoints - Building a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/centralized-access-to-vpc-private-endpoints.html）<br>Troubleshoot resolving domain name over a VPC peering connection | AWS re:Post（https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/vpc-peering-troubleshoot-dns-resolution） <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Update the Lambda functions to add a pre-snapshot hook. Move the code that generates unique IDs into the handlers. Publish a version of each Lambda function. Activate Lambda SnapStart for the published versions of the Lambda functions.<br>This solution will meet the startup performance requirement most cost-effectively for the following reasons:<br>Lambda SnapStart for Java: Lambda SnapStart significantly improves the cold start performance of Java functions by taking a snapshot of the initialized execution environment and reusing it for subsequent invocations. This directly addresses the requirement for Lambda functions to "initialize as quickly as possible."<br>Moving Unique ID Generation to Handlers: The current Lambda functions generate unique IDs during initialization (outside the handlers). This is problematic with SnapStart because the same snapshot is used for multiple function invocations, which would result in duplicate IDs. Moving the unique ID generation code into the handlers ensures that each function invocation generates a new, unique ID.<br>Pre-snapshot Hooks: Adding pre-snapshot hooks allows for proper preparation of the execution environment before the snapshot is taken. This ensures that libraries and classes are properly initialized and optimized before being captured in the snapshot, leading to better performance when the function is invoked.<br>Cost-Effectiveness: This solution is more cost-effective than option C because it doesn't use provisioned concurrency, which incurs charges even when the functions aren't being invoked. With option D, you only pay for the actual function invocations and the standard SnapStart costs.<br>Option C (using provisioned concurrency with SnapStart) would also improve startup performance but at a higher cost. Provisioned concurrency keeps execution environments warm and ready to respond, but you pay for this capacity regardless of whether it's being used. This makes it less cost-effective, especially for applications with variable or unpredictable traffic patterns.<br>By optimizing the code structure for SnapStart (moving unique ID generation to handlers and using pre-snapshot hooks) and avoiding the ongoing costs of provisioned concurrency, option D provides the best balance of meeting the startup performance requirements while minimizing costs.<br>Sources<br>What Are The Best Practices for Managing Cold Starts in AWS Lambda ? | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUCMh4YyniS4WieB786GGM9A/what-are-the-best-practices-for-managing-cold-starts-in-aws-lambda）<br>Reduce SDK startup time for AWS Lambda - AWS SDK for Java 2.x （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/lambda-optimize-starttime.html）<br>Improving API performance at Sonar with Lambda SnapStart and Micronaut | AWS Open Source Blog （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/opensource/improving-api-performance-at-sonar-with-lambda-snapstart-and-micronaut/）<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>A. Verify that Systems Manager Agent is installed on the instance and is running. B. Verify that the instance is assigned an appropriate IAM role for Systems Manager.<br>These are the two critical steps needed to troubleshoot why the EC2 instance doesn't appear as a managed instance in AWS Systems Manager:<br>Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) Verification (Option A):<br>When importing a VM from an on-premises environment using EC2 VM Import, the SSM Agent is not automatically installed on the resulting AMI.<br>The SSM Agent is essential for Systems Manager to communicate with and manage the EC2 instance.<br>The solutions architect needs to verify that the SSM Agent is properly installed and running on the imported instance.<br>Without the SSM Agent, the instance cannot communicate with the Systems Manager service and won't appear in the console.<br>IAM Role Assignment (Option B):<br>EC2 instances require an IAM role with appropriate permissions to communicate with Systems Manager.<br>The imported VM likely doesn't have the necessary IAM role attached to it.<br>The solutions architect needs to create and attach an IAM role with the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore managed policy (or equivalent permissions) to the instance.<br>Without this role, the instance won't have permission to communicate with the Systems Manager service.<br>The other options are not necessary or relevant for this specific issue:<br>C. Verify the existence of a VPC endpoint on the VPC - While VPC endpoints can enhance security by keeping traffic within the AWS network, they are optional. Since the instance is in a public subnet with a public IP address, it can communicate with Systems Manager over the internet without requiring VPC endpoints.<br>D. Verify that the AWS Application Discovery Agent is configured - The Application Discovery Agent is part of AWS Application Discovery Service, which is used for migration planning. It's not related to or required for Systems Manager functionality.<br>E. Verify the correct configuration of service-linked roles for Systems Manager - Service-linked roles are primarily used for AWS services to interact with other services on your behalf. They are not typically the cause of an instance not appearing in Systems Manager.<br>The most common reasons for an EC2 instance not appearing in Systems Manager are the absence of the SSM Agent or missing IAM permissions, which is why options A and B are the correct troubleshooting steps.<br>Sources<br>Troubleshooting managed node issues in Systems Manager with SAW | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/articles/ARRZ_rHRGiRQ2_MaNPDhISSw/troubleshooting-managed-node-issues-in-systems-manager-with-saw）<br>Configure instance permissions required for Systems Manager - AWS Systems Manager （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-permissions.html）<br>Unable to Connect to EC2 Instance via SSM Session Manager | AWS re:Post（https://repost.aws/questions/QUmw-Dgnm0RuaCyCLsOVuo5Q/unable-to-connect-to-ec2-instance-via-ssm-session-manager） <br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>C. Provision an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway in cache mode. Back up the on-premises Storage Gateway volumes with AWS Backup.<br>This solution meets all the requirements stated in the question for the following reasons:<br>iSCSI Connectivity Requirement: The company needs storage volumes that can be mounted as iSCSI devices from on-premises application servers. AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway specifically provides iSCSI connectivity, allowing on-premises applications to access cloud storage using the iSCSI protocol. File gateway, on the other hand, uses NFS or SMB protocols, not iSCSI.<br>Point-in-Time Copies with AWS Backup: The company needs to take point-in-time copies of volumes using AWS Backup. AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway integrates with AWS Backup, allowing the creation and management of point-in-time snapshots of the volumes. These snapshots are stored as Amazon EBS snapshots in AWS.<br>Low-Latency Access to Frequently Accessed Data: The cache mode of the volume gateway keeps frequently accessed data locally on-premises while storing the primary data in Amazon S3. This provides low-latency access to commonly used data, meeting the company's requirement for fast access to frequently accessed information.<br>Scalable Storage for Legacy Applications: Volume gateway in cache mode provides virtually unlimited storage capacity by leveraging Amazon S3 for primary storage, while only requiring local storage for the cache. This addresses the company's need for scalable storage as their data continues to grow.<br>Option D (AWS Storage Gateway file gateway in cache mode) is incorrect because:<br>File gateway does not provide iSCSI connectivity, which is a specific requirement mentioned in the question.<br>File gateway uses file-level protocols (NFS/SMB) rather than block-level protocols like iSCSI.<br>While file gateway can work with data stored in S3, it doesn't integrate with AWS Backup in the same way that volume gateway does for taking point-in-time copies of volumes.<br>The volume gateway in cache mode is the appropriate solution for this scenario as it provides the required iSCSI connectivity, works with AWS Backup for point-in-time copies, offers low-latency access to frequently accessed data, and provides scalable storage for the company's growing data needs.<br>Sources<br>Backup and recovery from on-premises infrastructure to AWS - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/backup-recovery/on-premises-to-aws.html）<br>Storage Gateway - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/configuring-storage-offload-vmware-cloud-aws/storage-gateway-option.html）<br>Volume Gateway | Amazon Web Services （https://aws.amazon.com/cn/storagegateway/volume/）<br>Backing up your volumes - AWS Storage Gateway （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/vgw/backing-up-volumes.html）<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>The company needs a solution that: &nbsp;<br>1. Encrypts/decrypts data in multiple Regions using the same KMS key. &nbsp;<br>2. Maintains security compliance (data must be encrypted before being stored in S3). &nbsp;<br>3. Avoids managing multiple keys (to simplify decryption across Regions). &nbsp;<br> Why Option A is the Best Solution? &nbsp;<br>✅ KMS Multi-Region Keys (MRK) allow: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - A primary key in one Region. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Replica keys in other Regions that share the same key material. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The application can use the local replica key in each Region, ensuring low latency while maintaining consistent encryption/decryption (since the keys are cryptographically identical). &nbsp;<br>✅ Minimal code changes – The application only needs to reference the replica key in its current Region. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Not Ideal? &nbsp;<br>❌ B: &nbsp;<br>- Different KMS keys per Region mean the application cannot decrypt data across Regions without re-encrypting it with the new key. &nbsp;<br>- Violates the requirement of using the same key. &nbsp;<br>❌ C: &nbsp;<br>- AWS Private CA is for TLS certificates, not KMS encryption. &nbsp;<br>- Does not solve the KMS key synchronization problem. &nbsp;<br>❌ D: &nbsp;<br>- Exporting KMS key material is highly discouraged (security risk). &nbsp;<br>- Parameter Store is not designed for secure key material storage (KMS is the correct service). &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>A is the best solution because KMS Multi-Region Keys allow the same encryption key to be used across Regions securely, with minimal application changes. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>The issue occurs because: &nbsp;<br>1. EC2 instances take longer to start due to downloading a large amount of content from S3 during user data execution. &nbsp;<br>2. ALB health checks start too early before the instances are fully ready, causing them to be marked as unhealthy and terminated. &nbsp;<br>3. This creates a loop where new instances launch, fail health checks, and get terminated repeatedly. &nbsp;<br> Why Option D is the Best Solution? &nbsp;<br>✅ Increase the health check grace period for the Auto Scaling group: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This gives instances more time to complete their startup tasks (downloading from S3) before health checks begin. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Prevents premature termination while keeping the existing user data scripts unchanged. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No changes to ALB settings or instance size are needed. &nbsp;<br> Why Other Options Are Not Ideal? &nbsp;<br>❌ A: Increasing EC2 instance size &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Might help with download speed, but does not guarantee instances will be ready before health checks start. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Unnecessary cost increase if the issue is timing, not compute power. &nbsp;<br>❌ B: Increasing ALB health check timeout &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This only extends how long the ALB waits for a health check response, not when health checks start. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Does not solve the root cause (instances need more time to initialize). &nbsp;<br>❌ C: Changing the ALB health check path &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - If the application is not yet running, changing the path won’t help—the instance still fails checks. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Does not address the delay in startup tasks. &nbsp;<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>D is the best solution because it delays health checks until instances are fully initialized, breaking the termination loop without modifying user data scripts. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">D</span>
<br>The requirements are: &nbsp;<br>1. Migrate Oracle databases to AWS while keeping some on-premises for compliance. &nbsp;<br>2. Spatial data support – PostgreSQL has native support for spatial data (PostGIS extension). &nbsp;<br>3. Cron jobs for maintenance – PostgreSQL allows scheduled jobs (via `pg_cron` or external schedulers). &nbsp;<br>4. Query on-premises data as foreign tables – AWS Direct Connect provides a secure, high-speed connection to on-premises systems, and PostgreSQL supports Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) to query remote databases. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- A: DynamoDB is not suitable for spatial data or complex SQL queries. Athena is for S3-based analytics, not Oracle foreign tables. &nbsp;<br>- B: SQL Server is not the best choice for migrating from Oracle, and Redshift is for analytics, not OLTP workloads. &nbsp;<br>- C: Running Oracle on EC2 is costly and doesn’t leverage AWS managed services. An internet gateway is not secure for direct database connections. &nbsp;<br> Why D is correct: &nbsp;<br>- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is a managed database service with PostGIS for spatial data. &nbsp;<br>- AWS SCT + DMS handles schema conversion and migration. &nbsp;<br>- Cron jobs can be implemented via `pg_cron` or Amazon EventBridge. &nbsp;<br>- AWS Direct Connect ensures secure, low-latency connectivity for querying on-premises Oracle databases as foreign tables. &nbsp;<br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Create a Lambda function to delete objects from an S3 bucket. Add the Lambda function as a custom resource in the CloudFormation stack with a DependsOn attribute that points to the S3 bucket resource.<br>This solution will resolve the CloudFormation stack deletion failure issue for the following reasons:<br>Root Cause of the Problem: The stack deletion is failing because CloudFormation cannot delete an S3 bucket that contains objects. Even though the application is designed to delete objects after 24 hours, there might still be objects in the bucket at the time of stack deletion.<br>Why Option A Works: Creating a Lambda function as a custom resource with a DependsOn attribute ensures that:<br>The Lambda function will run during the stack deletion process<br>It will delete all objects from the S3 bucket before CloudFormation attempts to delete the bucket itself<br>The DependsOn attribute ensures proper sequencing, making sure the Lambda function executes before CloudFormation tries to delete the bucket<br>Advantages of This Approach:<br>It handles the cleanup of objects automatically during stack deletion<br>It works even if there are versioned objects or objects that were missed by the application's 24-hour deletion process<br>It's a more robust solution that will work consistently across different environments<br>Option B (Modify the CloudFormation stack to attach a DeletionPolicy attribute with a value of Delete to the S3 bucket) is incorrect because:<br>The DeletionPolicy attribute with a value of Delete only tells CloudFormation to delete the bucket during stack deletion, but it doesn't automatically delete the objects within the bucket.<br>If the bucket contains any objects, the stack deletion will still fail even with this policy in place.<br>CloudFormation requires buckets to be empty before they can be deleted, regardless of the DeletionPolicy setting.<br>The Lambda function approach (Option A) is more comprehensive as it actively empties the bucket before CloudFormation attempts to delete it, addressing the root cause of the stack deletion failure. This solution meets the requirement of resolving the issue without major architecture changes, as it only adds a custom resource to the existing CloudFormation stack without modifying the core application architecture.<br>Sources<br>Issue deleting S3 Bucket via CloudFormation | AWS re:Post （https://repost.aws/questions/QUBbQap76TQ8-lp-j8Gr7XQw/issue-deleting-s3-bucket-via-cloudformation）<br>S3 Bucket Not Deleted When Deleting CloudFormation Stack | AWS re:Post（https://repost.aws/questions/QUWQxEijWhSS6TtNh_Qu8gwg/s3-bucket-not-deleted-when-deleting-cloudformation-stack） <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>C. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to expire incomplete multipart uploads 7 days after initiation. E. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days.<br>These two actions together will optimize the S3 costs for the company's application for the following reasons:<br>Expiring incomplete multipart uploads (Option C):<br>The scenario mentions that users often have poor internet connectivity when uploading videos, resulting in failed uploads.<br>When multipart uploads fail or are abandoned, the partially uploaded parts remain in the S3 bucket and continue to incur storage costs.<br>Creating a lifecycle configuration to expire incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days will automatically clean up these abandoned upload parts, preventing unnecessary storage costs.<br>This is especially important for large files like videos (over 100MB), as multipart uploads consist of multiple parts that can add up to significant storage costs if left unmanaged.<br>Transitioning to S3 Standard-IA after 180 days (Option E):<br>The scenario states that videos are frequently accessed in the first 180 days after upload, but access after that is rare.<br>S3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.<br>S3 Standard-IA offers a lower storage cost compared to S3 Standard, making it ideal for the rarely accessed older videos.<br>Since the videos are larger than 100MB, they easily meet the 128KB minimum object size for cost-effective use of S3 Standard-IA.<br>The transition after 180 days aligns perfectly with the described access pattern, keeping the videos in the most cost-effective storage class based on their access frequency.<br>Together, these two lifecycle configurations address both the cost optimization for long-term storage and the cleanup of failed uploads, which are the two main cost concerns mentioned in the scenario.

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Use a dynamic scaling policy. Enable warm pools for the Auto Scaling group. Use lifecycle hooks to run the user data script.<br>This solution will most effectively decrease application latency when new instances are launched during auto scaling for the following reasons:<br>Warm Pools: The key advantage of this solution is the use of warm pools, which maintain pre-initialized EC2 instances that are ready to quickly respond to scaling events. Since the scenario mentions that "launching the instance takes several minutes" due to the installation of required custom packages, warm pools directly address this issue by having instances already prepared and waiting in a "warmed" state.<br>Lifecycle Hooks: These allow the user data script to run during the instance initialization process before the instance is put into service. This ensures that all custom packages are properly installed and the instance is fully ready before it starts handling application traffic.<br>Dynamic Scaling Policy: This type of policy responds to real-time metrics (like the 95% CPU utilization mentioned in the scenario) to trigger scaling actions. When combined with warm pools, the response to high CPU utilization will be much faster since the instances are already pre-initialized.<br>Reduced Latency: Together, these features significantly reduce the time between when a scaling event is triggered and when new capacity is actually available to serve requests, directly addressing the requirement to "decrease application latency when new instances are launched."<br>Option A (using predictive scaling policy with instance maintenance policy and setting default instance warmup time to 0 seconds) has several limitations:<br>Setting the warmup time to 0 seconds would incorrectly mark instances as ready immediately after launch, even though they actually require several minutes to install custom packages. This could lead to routing traffic to instances that aren't fully initialized.<br>Predictive scaling is useful for anticipated load patterns but doesn't address the fundamental issue of slow instance initialization.<br>Instance maintenance policies are primarily designed for replacing unhealthy instances, not for improving scaling speed.<br>The warm pools approach in Option D directly addresses the core issue by having instances already initialized and ready to go, which is exactly what's needed when "the process of launching the instance takes several minutes" and you need to "decrease application latency when new instances are launched."<br>Sources<br>Instance maintenance policy for Auto Scaling group - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-maintenance-policy-overview-and-considerations.html）<br>Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html）<br>Decrease latency for applications with long boot times using warm pools - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html）<br>Auto Scaling groups - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html）<br>Use lifecycle hooks with a warm pool in Auto Scaling group - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/warm-pool-instance-lifecycle.html）<br>

<br> For the blog platform migration (ensuring real-time content updates):<br>- Option C is correct because Amazon EFS provides a shared, scalable, and highly available file system that can be mounted both on on-premises servers (via AWS Direct Connect or VPN) and EC2 instances. This allows multiple authors to continue updating blog content in real-time while the EC2 instances serve the latest content seamlessly.<br> For transferring 200 TB of archival data to Amazon S3 quickly:<br>- Option D is correct because AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is designed for large-scale data transfers (like 200 TB) efficiently and securely. It is a better choice than Snowcone SSD (Option E), which is meant for smaller datasets (up to 8 TB).<br> Why not the other options?<br>- Option A: A weekly cron job would introduce delays in content updates, which violates the requirement of real-time synchronization.<br>- Option B: EBS Multi-Attach volumes are limited to a single Availability Zone and require manual synchronization, making them unsuitable for a multi-AZ setup and real-time updates.<br>- Option E: Snowcone SSD is too small (max 8 TB) for 200 TB of data, whereas Snowball Edge Storage Optimized can handle much larger datasets.<br> Final Answer:<br>✅ C (Use Amazon EFS for real-time blog content updates) &nbsp;<br>✅ D (Use AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized for large archival data transfer)<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>D. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the Tomcat servers with auto scaling in multiple Availability Zones. Store application data in an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. Deploy Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer to scale for increased traffic.<br>This solution will meet the requirements with the LEAST operational overhead for the following reasons:<br>Managed Services Approach: Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that handles the underlying infrastructure management, including capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. This significantly reduces operational overhead compared to solutions where you need to manage these components yourself.<br>Simplified Deployment: Elastic Beanstalk provides a streamlined way to deploy Java applications on Tomcat without needing to configure the underlying infrastructure. Since the company only has access to JAR files and not the source code, Elastic Beanstalk's support for deploying packaged applications is ideal.<br>Managed Database: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL provides a fully managed database service that handles routine database tasks such as backups, patch management, and high availability. This eliminates the need to manage a PostgreSQL database manually.<br>Automatic Scaling: The combination of Elastic Beanstalk's auto scaling capabilities and the Application Load Balancer allows the application to automatically handle the increased traffic at the end of each month without manual intervention.<br>Content Delivery Optimization: CloudFront integration improves performance and reduces latency for end users by caching content at edge locations, which is beneficial for web applications.<br>High Availability: Deploying across multiple Availability Zones ensures the application remains available even if one zone experiences issues.<br>Option B (Amazon EKS in an Auto Scaling group across multiple AWS Regions) would involve significantly more operational overhead because:<br>Kubernetes Complexity: Managing Kubernetes clusters requires specialized knowledge and ongoing maintenance.<br>Container Management: Creating and maintaining container images for Tomcat and PostgreSQL would require additional operational effort.<br>Multi-Region Deployment: Managing deployments across multiple AWS Regions adds complexity that isn't necessary for the stated requirements.<br>Database Management: Running PostgreSQL in containers rather than using a managed service like RDS would require additional operational overhead for database administration tasks.<br>The Elastic Beanstalk solution (Option D) provides a much more streamlined approach that aligns perfectly with the company's constraints (no source code access, only JAR files) while minimizing operational overhead and still providing the necessary scalability to handle variable traffic patterns.<br>Sources<br>Migrate from IBM WebSphere Application Server to Apache Tomcat on Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-from-ibm-websphere-application-server-to-apache-tomcat-on-amazon-ec2-with-auto-scaling.html）<br>Migrate from Oracle WebLogic to Apache Tomcat (TomEE) on Amazon ECS - AWS Prescriptive Guidance（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-from-oracle-weblogic-to-apache-tomcat-tomee-on-amazon-ecs.html） <br>Migrate on-premises Java applications to AWS using AWS App2Container - AWS Prescriptive Guidance（https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-on-premises-java-applications-to-aws-using-aws-app2container.html） <br>Considering online migration options - AWS Prescriptive Guidance （https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-databases-postgresql-ec2/considering-online-migration-options.html）<br>

<br>The correct answer is D. Create an API Gateway API Key and usage plan. Define throttling limits and quotas in the usage plan. Associate the usage plan with the Production stage and the API key. Share the API key with the external development team.<br>- Option A suggests using Amazon SQS queues to decouple API Gateway from Lambda, but this requires reworking the Lambda functions to consume messages from the queue, which violates the requirement of not modifying the Lambda functions.<br>- Option B proposes using provisioned concurrency and Application Auto Scaling, but this does not limit API usage or costs—it only helps manage Lambda concurrency. Additionally, it does not address sudden spikes in API usage.<br>- Option C suggests using AWS WAF with a rate-based rule, but this is more complex than necessary and is typically used for security (e.g., DDoS protection) rather than cost control. It also requires managing WAF rules, which is not the most straightforward solution.<br>- Option D is the best choice because:<br> &nbsp;- API Gateway usage plans allow you to set throttling limits (rate limits) and quotas (daily/monthly limits) to control how much the API can be called.<br> &nbsp;- API keys help track and restrict usage to authorized consumers (the external team).<br> &nbsp;- This solution does not require changes to the Lambda functions and is the most cost-effective way to limit usage and prevent unexpected cost spikes.<br>Thus, D is the correct answer.<br>

<br>The most cost-effective solution to ensure that the EC2 instances always use the most up-to-date pricing information is:<br>C. Load Mountpoint for Amazon S3 onto the AMI of the EC2 instances. Configure Mountpoint for Amazon S3 to mount the S3 bucket that contains the pricing file. Update the ticketing service to point to the mount point and path to access the S3 object.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Problem Analysis:<br> &nbsp; - The pricing file is frequently updated (every 1-15 minutes) in an S3 bucket.<br> &nbsp; - EC2 instances download the file only at launch, leading to outdated pricing.<br> &nbsp; - The solution must ensure real-time access to the latest pricing file without manual intervention.<br>2. Why Option C?:<br> &nbsp; - Mountpoint for Amazon S3 allows EC2 instances to directly access the S3 bucket as a local file system.<br> &nbsp; - The ticketing service can read the pricing file in real-time from the mounted S3 bucket, eliminating the need for periodic downloads or synchronization.<br> &nbsp; - This is cost-effective because:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - No additional services (Lambda, DynamoDB, EFS, or EBS Multi-Attach) are required.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - S3 is already being used, and Mountpoint for S3 is a lightweight, open-source solution.<br> &nbsp; - Ensures immediate consistency—any updates to the pricing file in S3 are immediately available to all EC2 instances.<br>3. Why Not Other Options?:<br> &nbsp; - A (DynamoDB): Overkill for a pricing file that doesn’t require NoSQL capabilities. Adds complexity and cost (DynamoDB read/write operations).<br> &nbsp; - B (EFS): EFS is expensive for this use case (pay for storage + throughput). Requires Lambda to sync updates, adding complexity.<br> &nbsp; - D (EBS Multi-Attach): EBS Multi-Attach is not cost-effective (limited to a single Availability Zone, requires manual updates, and incurs additional costs for Multi-Attach volumes).<br>

<br>Option B suggests using AWS Service Catalog, which is specifically designed for this use case. It allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of approved IT services that users can deploy with predefined permissions and constraints. <br>- AWS Service Catalog Product: You can create a product from the CloudFormation template, which standardizes the environment setup.<br>- Launch Constraint: This allows you to specify the existing role (the manager's role) that Service Catalog will use to launch the product, without granting users direct access to that role.<br>- Permissions: Users only need permissions to access AWS Service Catalog APIs (not CloudFormation, EC2, or Auto Scaling directly), ensuring they cannot modify or launch resources outside the approved template.<br>- Self-Service: Users can launch their own environments via the AWS Service Catalog console without requiring elevated permissions.<br> Why not the other options?<br>- A: Allowing users to assume the manager’s role is risky, even with restrictions, because role assumption grants temporary broad permissions.<br>- C: Granting users direct CloudFormation and S3 permissions (even with conditions) still exposes more risk than necessary, as users could potentially modify templates or launch unauthorized stacks.<br>- D: Elastic Beanstalk is not the right tool here, as it’s meant for deploying applications rather than managing short-lived testing environments with strict permission controls.<br>Thus, B is the most secure and scalable solution. <br>

<br>1. A. Use AWS CloudFormation to replicate the infrastructure in the second Region &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - CloudFormation allows infrastructure-as-code (IaC), enabling consistent deployment across Regions with minimal administrative overhead. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Using parameters (like Region) makes the template reusable. &nbsp;<br>2. D. Update Route 53 to use latency-based routing &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Latency-based routing improves access time by directing users to the Region with the lowest latency. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This is better than weighted routing (Option C) because it optimizes performance rather than splitting traffic arbitrarily. &nbsp;<br>3. E. Enable DynamoDB Streams and create a global table &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - DynamoDB Global Tables provide multi-Region replication for disaster recovery and low-latency access. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Enabling DynamoDB Streams is required before converting an existing table into a global table. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- B: Manually recreating infrastructure via the AWS Console is error-prone and increases administrative overhead. &nbsp;<br>- C: Weighted routing (50/50 split) doesn’t optimize performance like latency-based routing. &nbsp;<br>- F: While this would work, it’s unnecessary because you can directly convert the existing table into a global table (Option E is more efficient). &nbsp;<br>

<br> Key Requirements:<br>1. Eliminate EC2 instances – The solution must replace the EC2-based container orchestration with a serverless or managed service.<br>2. Process files from EFS – The current setup uses EFS, but migrating to Amazon S3 is acceptable if it simplifies the architecture.<br>3. Event-driven execution – The solution should trigger processing when new files arrive.<br>4. Long-running processing (up to 2 hours) – AWS Fargate supports long-running tasks, whereas Lambda has a maximum timeout of 15 minutes (which rules out Option D).<br> Analysis of Options:<br>- Option A: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Uses EventBridge to trigger Fargate tasks when files are added to EFS. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Problem: EventBridge does not natively support EFS event notifications. EFS events must be detected via a Lambda function or another service, making this option incomplete.<br>- Option B: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Uses an EFS event notification to trigger a Fargate service that selects and starts the appropriate task. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Problem: EFS event notifications cannot directly invoke Fargate tasks. They require an intermediary (like Lambda) to process the event and start the task.<br>- Option C: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Migrates file storage to Amazon S3 (simpler than EFS for event-driven workflows). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Uses S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function, which selects and starts the appropriate Fargate task. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Fargate supports long-running tasks (up to 2 hours). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- This is the most viable solution because it replaces EC2 with serverless (Lambda + Fargate) and uses S3 events for reliable triggering.<br>- Option D: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Uses Lambda container images for processing. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;- Problem: Lambda has a 15-minute maximum runtime, which is insufficient for 2-hour processing tasks. &nbsp;<br> Why Option C is Correct:<br>- Serverless architecture (no EC2 instances). &nbsp;<br>- S3 event notifications reliably trigger Lambda. &nbsp;<br>- Lambda invokes Fargate tasks, which can run for up to 2 hours. &nbsp;<br>- EFS is replaced with S3, simplifying event-driven workflows. &nbsp;<br>https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/143048-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-sap-c02/<br><br><br>

<summary>Answer</summary>
<div translate="no">
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">A</span>
<br>- Option A: Setting up an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway on - premises is a good choice as it allows the company to use its existing file system to access the videos. The MAM solution can easily push videos into the file gateway. Using Amazon Rekognition to build a collection from the face catalog and a Lambda function to interact with the Rekognition SDK to process videos stored in the S3 files backing the file gateway is an efficient way. This approach has relatively low ongoing management overhead as AWS manages much of the underlying infrastructure of the Storage Gateway and Rekognition. It also causes minimal disruption to the existing system as it can work with the current MAM solution and file system. So, this option meets the requirements.<br>- Option B: A tape gateway in AWS Storage Gateway is mainly for migrating tape - based data to AWS and providing a tape - like interface. Processing videos directly in the tape gateway by Amazon Rekognition is not an efficient or common approach. It would likely have higher management overhead and may not work as smoothly as using a file gateway. So, this option is not the best choice.<br>- Option C: Configuring an Amazon Kinesis Video Streams for video ingestion would require significant changes to the existing system as it is not directly integrated with the on - premises tape - based storage and MAM solution. Also, managing the Kinesis Video Streams, stream consumers, and the overall ingestion process would add more ongoing management overhead compared to using a Storage Gateway. So, this option is not optimal.<br>- Option D: Running OpenCV libraries on an Amazon EC2 instance requires more hands - on management for setting up, configuring, and maintaining the EC2 instance, EBS volume, and the OpenCV environment. It also involves more complex operations to copy data and process videos compared to using AWS - managed services like Storage Gateway and Rekognition. So, this option has higher management overhead and is not the best fit for the requirements. <br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>A. Purchase the same Reserved Instances for an additional 3-year term with All Upfront payment. Purchase a 3-year Compute Savings Plan with All Upfront payment in the management account to cover any additional compute costs.<br>This strategy will provide the company with the MOST cost savings for the following reasons:<br>Maximum Discount Percentage: 3-year commitments with All Upfront payment provide the highest possible discount rates:<br>3-year Standard Reserved Instances with All Upfront payment offer up to 72% savings on EC2 instances<br>3-year Compute Savings Plans with All Upfront payment offer up to 66% savings on compute usage<br>Long-term Commitment Alignment: The company explicitly states they need EC2 instances for 3 more years, making the 3-year commitment period perfectly aligned with their stated requirements.<br>Comprehensive Coverage: This strategy provides a two-pronged approach:<br>Reserved Instances cover specific EC2 instance types, sizes, and regions that the company knows they'll need<br>Compute Savings Plans provide flexible coverage for the new serverless workload (including Lambda and Fargate) as well as any additional EC2 usage not covered by Reserved Instances<br>Organization-wide Benefits: Purchasing the Compute Savings Plan in the management account allows the savings to automatically apply across all member accounts in the organization, maximizing utilization and preventing wasted commitments.<br>Predictable Costs: With All Upfront payments, the company eliminates future price fluctuations for their committed usage, providing budget certainty for the next 3 years.<br>Option B (1-year Compute Savings Plans with No Upfront payment in each member account) would provide less overall savings for several reasons:<br>Lower Discount Rate: 1-year commitments offer significantly lower discount percentages compared to 3-year commitments (typically 31-40% vs. 60-72%).<br>No Upfront Payment: While this requires less initial capital, it results in a lower overall discount compared to All Upfront payment options.<br>Distributed Management: Managing separate Savings Plans in each member account creates administrative overhead and potential inefficiencies in utilization.<br>Misalignment with Needs: The company explicitly states they need EC2 instances for 3 more years, making the 1-year commitment period unnecessarily short and requiring annual renewals.<br>Given the company's stated 3-year requirement for EC2 instances and their previous experience with Reserved Instances, the combination of 3-year Reserved Instances and 3-year Compute Savings Plans with All Upfront payment will maximize their cost savings while providing the necessary coverage for both their traditional EC2 workloads and their new serverless applications.<br>Sources<br>Main Differences b/t EC2 Saving Plans (Compute and Instance) and Reserved Instances | AWS re:Post (https://repost.aws/questions/QUeethov1VSDm1QvziWqMHzw/main-differences-b-t-ec2-saving-plans-compute-and-instance-and-reserved-instances)<br>Decide on Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for EC2 instances | AWS re:Post (https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ec2-savings-plan-reserved-instances)<br>COST07-BP01 Perform pricing model analysis - AWS Well-Architected Framework (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2025-02-25/framework/cost_pricing_model_analysis.html)<br><br><br>

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">C</span>
<br>The correct answer is C. Here's the breakdown of why this is the best approach for the fastest migration while meeting compliance requirements:<br> Why Option C is Correct:<br>1. AWS Application Migration Service (Agentless Appliance) &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The agentless appliance is deployed to VMware vCenter, eliminating the need to install agents on each VM (which would require compliance approvals for each installation). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - This allows for lift-and-shift migration with minimal changes to the VMs.<br>2. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The shared Windows folder (larger than 100 GB) is best migrated to FSx for Windows File Server, which is fully compatible with Windows file shares (supports SMB protocol, Active Directory integration, and Windows permissions). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - After migration, the file share can be remapped on each VM to point to FSx.<br>3. Fastest Migration Path &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Since there’s already a 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection, transferring data over the network is feasible. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - No need for Snowcone (which would introduce delays due to shipping). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Agentless migration avoids compliance bottlenecks (no per-VM agent installations).<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- A: Uses VM Import/Export (manual process) and Amazon EFS (not ideal for Windows file shares). &nbsp;<br>- B: Only discovers VMs (does not perform migration). &nbsp;<br>- D: Requires installing agents on each hypervisor, which may need compliance approvals and slow down the process. &nbsp;<br>- E: Uses Snowcone, which is unnecessary given the high-bandwidth Direct Connect connection and would delay migration.<br> Final Answer:<br>C. Deploy the AWS Application Migration Service agentless appliance to VMware vCenter. Copy the Windows file share data to a new Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. After migration, remap the file share on each VM to the FSx for Windows File Server file system.<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:<br>B. Use a delegated administrator account to create an AWS CloudTrail Lake data store. Specify CloudTrail management events for the data store. Enable the data store for all accounts in the organization. Query the data in CloudTrail Lake.<br>This solution best meets the requirements for the following reasons:<br>SQL Querying Capability: CloudTrail Lake provides native SQL querying capabilities, which directly addresses the requirement to "query the data from a central location by using SQL." CloudTrail Lake is specifically designed to support SQL-based analysis of AWS account activity.<br>Centralized Storage: By creating a CloudTrail Lake data store in a delegated administrator account and enabling it for all accounts in the organization, the company can collect and store AWS account activity from all member accounts in a single, centralized location. This eliminates the need to set up and manage separate trails in each account.<br>Organization-wide Coverage: Using a delegated administrator approach with CloudTrail Lake allows for seamless collection of management events from all accounts in the AWS Organization without having to configure each account individually.<br>Simplified Management: This solution reduces operational overhead by centralizing both the storage and querying of account activity in one place, rather than requiring cross-account configurations.<br>Purpose-Built for the Use Case: CloudTrail Lake is specifically designed for the long-term storage, analysis, and SQL-based querying of AWS account activity data across an organization.<br>Option A (using CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch cross-account observability) has several limitations:<br>CloudWatch Logs Insights uses its own query language, not standard SQL, which doesn't meet the requirement to query the data using SQL.<br>It requires setting up CloudTrail in each account and configuring CloudWatch cross-account observability, which is more complex and has higher operational overhead.<br>While CloudWatch Logs Insights is powerful for log analysis, it's not specifically optimized for querying AWS account activity across an organization in the way that CloudTrail Lake is.<br>CloudTrail Lake is the purpose-built solution for this exact use case - centralized storage and SQL-based querying of AWS account activity across an organization - making Option B the correct answer.<br>Sources<br>Logging strategies for security incident response | AWS Security Blog (https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/security/logging-strategies-for-security-incident-response/)<br>AWS CloudTrail or Amazon CloudWatch? - AWS CloudTrail or Amazon CloudWatch?

<br>The scenario requires implementing user authorization for an API Gateway HTTP API that invokes a Lambda function, using an existing third-party OAuth identity provider. Here’s why Option A is the best solution: &nbsp;<br>1. API Gateway Lambda Authorizer &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - A Lambda authorizer can validate OAuth tokens issued by the third-party identity provider. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The authorizer checks the token's validity and returns an IAM policy allowing or denying access to the API. &nbsp;<br>2. Token Handling &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The web application retrieves tokens from the third-party identity provider (as it already does for other apps). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The tokens are included in the `Authorization` header when calling the API Gateway. &nbsp;<br>3. Secure API Access &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The Lambda authorizer is enforced on all API routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options? &nbsp;<br>- Option B: AWS Directory Service is not designed to validate OAuth tokens, and using IAM Identity Center as a SAML provider is unnecessary for this use case. &nbsp;<br>- Option C: IAM Identity Center does not provide "zero-configuration" OAuth token validation for API Gateway. STS tokens are used for AWS service access, not OAuth-based API authorization. &nbsp;<br>- Option D: IAM users are not suitable for web application user authentication, and request parameters are not a secure way to handle authorization. &nbsp;<br>Thus, Option A is the most appropriate solution. &nbsp;<br>

<br> Requirements:<br>1. Automated solution to encrypt existing unencrypted EBS volumes.<br>2. Prevent creation of new unencrypted EBS volumes.<br> Why Option D?<br>- AWS Config Managed Rule: Can identify unencrypted EBS volumes (e.g., using the `ebs-encryption-by-default` or `ec2-encrypted-volumes` rule).<br>- Automatic Remediation: Can trigger a Systems Manager Automation runbook to create an encrypted copy of the unencrypted volume and attach it to the instance.<br>- AWS Account Setting for EBS Encryption: Enabling default EBS encryption ensures all new EBS volumes are automatically encrypted, preventing the creation of unencrypted volumes.<br> Why Not Other Options?<br>- Option A: Incorrect because a KMS key policy cannot deny the creation of unencrypted EBS volumes. KMS policies control key usage, not EC2/EBS API actions. You need SCPs or default encryption settings to enforce this.<br>- Option B: Incorrect because Fleet Manager is not the right tool for identifying unencrypted volumes (AWS Config is better suited). Also, while SCPs can deny unencrypted volume creation, the question emphasizes automated remediation, which is better handled via AWS Config + Systems Manager.<br>- Option C: Incorrect because Fleet Manager is not the optimal tool for this use case, and while enabling default EBS encryption helps, it doesn’t address existing unencrypted volumes as comprehensively as AWS Config + Systems Manager.<br> Key Takeaways:<br>- For existing volumes: AWS Config + Systems Manager Automation for remediation.<br>- For new volumes: Enable default EBS encryption at the account level.<br>

AWS/Usage Namespace in CloudWatch: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - AWS Fargate service quotas (including the maximum number of tasks) are published as metrics under the `AWS/Usage` namespace in Amazon CloudWatch.<br> &nbsp; - These metrics track usage against service limits (quotas).<br>2. Setting Up the Alarm: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - You can create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors the metric value (current usage) relative to the `SERVICE_QUOTA` (maximum allowed tasks).<br> &nbsp; - The math expression `metric/SERVICE_QUOTA(metric)*100` calculates the percentage of quota usage.<br> &nbsp; - When this value exceeds 80%, the alarm triggers.<br>3. Notification via Amazon SNS: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - The alarm can be configured to send a notification to the development team using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).<br> Why Other Options Are Incorrect:<br>- Option A: The `Sample Count` statistic in CloudWatch does not track service quotas. It counts the number of data points, not the actual usage vs. quota.<br>- Option C: Polling ECS metrics manually with Lambda is inefficient and unnecessary when CloudWatch already provides quota monitoring.<br>- Option D: AWS Config does not evaluate service quota usage in real-time; it checks for compliance with rules, not dynamic quota thresholds.<br> Conclusion: &nbsp;<br>Option B is the most efficient and AWS-recommended way to monitor Fargate task quotas and notify the team when nearing the limit. &nbsp;<br>

<br> Requirements:<br>1. Prevent EC2 instances in the application account from accessing the internet (must remove NAT gateway).<br>2. Allow EC2 instances to access Amazon S3 (for application data).<br>3. Allow connectivity to AWS Systems Manager (SSM) (for Patch Manager).<br>4. Allow connectivity to the patch source repository in the core account's private VPC.<br> Solution Breakdown:<br>- VPC Endpoints for Systems Manager and Amazon S3:<br> &nbsp;- Interface VPC endpoints (PrivateLink) for SSM allow private connectivity without internet access.<br> &nbsp;- Gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 allows private access to S3 without NAT or internet.<br>- Delete the NAT gateway (since internet access is no longer allowed).<br>- VPC Peering Connection:<br> &nbsp;- Establishes a direct private connection between the application account VPC and the core account VPC.<br> &nbsp;- Update route tables in both VPCs to allow traffic to the patch source repository.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A: Using a custom VPN server is overly complex and introduces unnecessary management overhead. Network ACLs blocking port 80 won't fully prevent internet access (other ports could still be used).<br>- B: Private VIFs (Direct Connect) are expensive and unnecessary for this use case. Transit Gateway is overkill if VPC peering suffices.<br>- D: Blocking inbound port 80 doesn't prevent outbound internet access. Transit Gateway is not needed when VPC peering is simpler and cheaper.<br> Key Points:<br>- VPC endpoints (SSM & S3) ensure private connectivity to AWS services.<br>- VPC peering provides direct access to the patch repository in the core account.<br>- No internet access is maintained by removing the NAT gateway.<br>

<br>The correct answer is C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to detect low utilization of EC2 instances reported by AWS Trusted Advisor. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function that filters the data by tags for department, business unit, and environment and stops underutilized development EC2 instances.<br> Explanation:<br>1. AWS Business Support includes AWS Trusted Advisor, which provides cost optimization checks, including identifying underutilized EC2 instances based on CPU utilization and network I/O metrics. This eliminates the need for manual monitoring or custom dashboards.<br>2. Least Operational Overhead: Trusted Advisor already monitors and reports underutilized instances, so you don't need to set up additional monitoring (unlike options A, B, or D).<br>3. Automation with EventBridge & Lambda: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - An EventBridge rule can trigger when Trusted Advisor detects underutilized instances. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - A Lambda function can filter instances by tags (department, business unit, environment) and stop development instances that meet the criteria. &nbsp;<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- A & B: These require setting up custom monitoring (CloudWatch dashboards or Systems Manager), which adds operational overhead.<br>- D: This involves a manual, daily Lambda function and DynamoDB storage, which is more complex and less efficient than using Trusted Advisor.<br> Key Takeaway:<br>AWS Trusted Advisor (included with Business Support) already provides underutilized EC2 instance detection, so leveraging it with EventBridge and Lambda is the most efficient solution. <br>

<br>The most cost-effective solution to address the issue of slow responses during peak times while maintaining performance is:<br>D. Create an Auto Scaling group. Attach the Auto Scaling group to the target group of the NLB. Set the minimum capacity to 4 and the maximum capacity to 28. Purchase Reserved Instances for four instances.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Problem Analysis:<br> &nbsp; - The application runs 24/7 with 20 On-Demand Instances but experiences 100% CPU utilization during peak times, causing slow responses.<br> &nbsp; - Current setup is inefficient because the instances are underutilized (10% CPU normally) but cannot handle spikes.<br>2. Why Auto Scaling?<br> &nbsp; - Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts capacity based on demand, scaling out during peak times and scaling in during low usage.<br> &nbsp; - This ensures performance during spikes while reducing costs when demand is low.<br>3. Why Reserved Instances (RIs) for Baseline Capacity?<br> &nbsp; - Since the application runs 24/7, purchasing RIs for the minimum capacity (4 instances) saves costs compared to On-Demand pricing.<br> &nbsp; - The remaining instances (scaled up to 28) can use On-Demand or Spot Instances (though the option doesn't explicitly mention Spot, Auto Scaling can optimize costs).<br>4. Why Option D Over Others?<br> &nbsp; - Option A suggests a fixed high capacity (min 20, desired 28) with RIs for 20 instances. This is not cost-effective because it doesn’t scale down during low usage.<br> &nbsp; - Option B uses a Spot Fleet with On-Demand as default, but Spot Fleets are better for fault-tolerant workloads, and this doesn’t address dynamic scaling.<br> &nbsp; - Option C suggests replacing NLB with ALB and using Spot Instances, but Spot Instances can be interrupted, which is risky for a 24/7 application. Also, ALB is unnecessary since the app is stateless and NLB is sufficient.<br>5. Cost Optimization in Option D:<br> &nbsp; - Min capacity (4 instances) covered by RIs for long-term savings.<br> &nbsp; - Auto Scaling handles spikes (up to 28 instances) without over-provisioning.<br> &nbsp; - No need for ALB (stateless app works fine with NLB).<br> Conclusion:<br>Option D provides the best balance of cost savings and performance by leveraging Auto Scaling for dynamic demand and RIs for baseline capacity. <br>

<br>he most cost-effective solution that meets the requirements is Option B. Here's why:<br> Key Requirements:<br>1. Data collection every 5 seconds (high frequency).<br>2. Enrichment before storing in Amazon S3.<br>3. Data must be available in S3 within 30 minutes.<br>4. Cost-effectiveness (minimize unnecessary processing/storage).<br> Analysis of Options:<br> Option A: AWS IoT Rule → Lambda → S3<br>- Pros: Simple, direct invocation of Lambda for enrichment.<br>- Cons: <br> &nbsp;- High cost: Lambda is invoked every 5 seconds (high frequency), leading to many invocations.<br> &nbsp;- No batching: Each Lambda call writes individually to S3, increasing costs.<br> Option B: AWS IoT Rule → Kinesis Data Firehose (+ Lambda Enrichment) → S3<br>- Pros:<br> &nbsp;- Buffering: Firehose can batch data (set to 900 seconds = 15 minutes) before writing to S3, reducing PUT requests.<br> &nbsp;- Built-in Lambda integration: Firehose can invoke Lambda for enrichment only when needed, optimizing cost.<br> &nbsp;- S3 delivery is managed by Firehose, which is cost-effective for high-frequency data.<br>- Cons: None significant for this use case.<br>- Best fit: Balances cost, performance, and meets the 30-minute SLA.<br> Option C: AWS IoT Rule → Timestream → Lambda → S3<br>- Pros: Timestream is good for time-series data.<br>- Cons: <br> &nbsp;- Overkill for this use case: No need for time-series database since data is just being enriched and stored in S3.<br> &nbsp;- Higher cost: Timestream charges for storage and queries, which are unnecessary here.<br> Option D: AWS IoT Rule → Kinesis Data Streams → Lambda → S3<br>- Pros: Kinesis can handle streaming data.<br>- Cons: <br> &nbsp;- More expensive than Firehose: Kinesis Data Streams requires managing shards (additional cost).<br> &nbsp;- Lambda must poll Kinesis, increasing complexity and cost compared to Firehose’s built-in integration.<br> Why Option B Wins:<br>- Kinesis Data Firehose is optimized for buffering and batching, reducing S3 PUT costs.<br>- Lambda is only used for enrichment (not per message), reducing invocation costs.<br>- Fully serverless and managed, minimizing operational overhead.<br>- Meets the 30-minute SLA with the 15-minute buffering setting.<br><br><br>

<br>Based on the information provided, the correct answers are:<br>A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the data scientists' VPC. E.

<br>The correct answer is A. Request access to Migration Evaluator. Run the Migration Evaluator Collector and import the data. Configure a scenario. Export a Quick Insights report from Migration Evaluator.<br> Explanation:<br>1. Migration Evaluator (formerly TSO Logic) is an AWS tool designed to help customers analyze their on-premises workloads and estimate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) when migrating to AWS. &nbsp;<br>2. The process involves: &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Running the Migration Evaluator Collector on-premises to gather data about the current infrastructure (Kubernetes cluster, PostgreSQL database, etc.). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Importing this data into Migration Evaluator to configure a migration scenario (e.g., moving to Amazon EKS and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; - Generating a Quick Insights report, which provides a TCO comparison between on-premises and AWS. &nbsp;<br>3. This approach is the most accurate way to estimate costs for migrating both the Kubernetes cluster and the database to AWS.<br> Why Not the Other Options?<br>- B: AWS DMS is for database migration, not TCO estimation. AWS Pricing Calculator alone doesn’t account for on-premises costs. &nbsp;<br>- C: AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is for rehosting servers (lift-and-shift), not for Kubernetes or TCO analysis. &nbsp;<br>- D: The Cloud Economics Center provides general best practices, not workload-specific TCO estimates. The Cost and Usage Report (CUR) is for existing AWS spend, not on-premises comparisons.<br>Thus, Migration Evaluator (Option A) is the correct choice for estimating TCO before migration.<br>

<br> Option A: Create a gateway VPC endpoint for the S3 bucket &nbsp;<br>- Currently, traffic between the ECS cluster and S3 flows through a NAT gateway, which incurs data processing costs. &nbsp;<br>- A Gateway VPC endpoint for S3 allows private connectivity between the VPC and S3 without using a NAT gateway, reducing costs while maintaining availability. &nbsp;<br> Option E: Replace the predictive scaling policy with scheduled scaling policies for the scheduled events &nbsp;<br>- Since the company knows the exact date and time of each event, scheduled scaling policies are more cost-effective than predictive scaling. &nbsp;<br>- Predictive scaling uses machine learning to forecast demand, which may lead to over-provisioning (increasing costs) or under-provisioning (reducing availability). Scheduled scaling ensures resources are ready exactly when needed. &nbsp;<br> Why not the other options? &nbsp;<br>- B (Spot Instances with equal weight): While Spot Instances can reduce costs, they are not reliable for time-sensitive, high-availability workloads like ticketing platforms. Using them equally with On-Demand could risk availability. &nbsp;<br>- C (On-Demand Capacity Reservations): This ensures capacity but does not optimize costs—it actually locks in higher expenses by reserving instances in advance. &nbsp;<br>- D (S3 Transfer Acceleration): This is used to speed up transfers over long distances, but since the S3 bucket and ECS cluster are in the same region, it provides no benefit and adds unnecessary cost. &nbsp;<br> Final Answer: &nbsp;<br>✅ A (Reduce NAT gateway costs with a VPC endpoint for S3) &nbsp;<br>✅ E (Replace predictive scaling with scheduled scaling for known events)<br>
